Kamado smoker grills are known to be very good heat insulators due to their ceramic build and this version of it is no exception.

This ceramic grill smoker, which is the smaller size of the two kinds in production, serves as one of the best smoker grills for the money.

Considering its make, you can be sure of stable temperature consistencies when smoking, grilling, searing or baking pizzas. The ceramic build holds and retains heat well, making food turn out nicely done and juicy.

It is beautiful to look upon sitting in a 2 layer, stainless steel grill grate for adjusting food while cooking. Also an exterior thermometer and cast iron made damper - to make your control of temperatures seamless, a strong lid hinge, 304 square inches stainless steel cooking grid, and a free ash removal tool to clean up ash.

We love this Egg which is of good pricing, easily available and has over 10 years warranty to it.

This combo is a 3-tier functional device; smoking, grilling and roasting. It seems fancy at first glance but is a super power cooker for evenly cooked meals without charcoal or oil.

This wood smoker sits in 3 layers of grate which can cook up to 25 lbs. of food by infrared which keeps food properly seared on the outside and done on the inside but juicy as you will imagine. It has a modern look with an internal smoker box to fill in wood chips that are used to support its infrared or grill form of cooking.

The strongest advantage of this device is its design which avoids flare ups when cooking which makes it safe to use and avoids food burns.

It is a very affordable grill smoker with an average pricing under $500 and it is the perfect home smoker grill for individual use or for a small family. One other cool feature is that it is easily assembled.

<h3>The Party Plus</h3>

<h2>What should you look out for when buying a grill smoker combo?</h2>
<h3>Is it versatile in function?</h3>
This is what this device is all about, the ability to smoke, grill and do more possibly. Anything less than this is not a smoker grill combo.
<h3>Can you make more food at a go?</h3>
Determine the number of people you are likely to feed and purchase a device that serves this need. With all the functions this device serves you will be able to not only feed more people but also cook more food than you would ever need.
<h3>Is it reasonably priced?</h3>
Aim for an option that works with your budget and satisfies your needs as well. Not necessarily cheap as you will get cheap and stressful results, and not costly which is inspired by brand names.
<h3>Are temperatures easily controlled with it?</h3>
The device should clearly have a thermometer inward or outward to help you control temperatures with ease. There should be enough vents/dampers to aid this process as well. Anything not in this category, ignore it, otherwise, your hands might be the item for grilling.
<h3>Are it and its parts easy to find?</h3>
Amazon is a great way to check for this. Some brands restrict the availability of their products to some dealerships which could be time-consuming when looking for a grill smoker combo. This means if you need to change some parts of the combo after a while, you are sure to face the same difficulty finding them. Choose combos that are readily available in an open market backed by a virtual community for your easy finds.

Check for warranties of at least 1 year. Companies that offer no warranties cannot be relied on. You might have a manufacturing fault after your purchase and the warranty will come in handy.","5 Best Rated Grill Smoker Combo On The Market (%%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%)"

<h3><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001H9RPNI?tag=brobbq-gas-grill-200-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">1. Char-Griller 3001 Grillin' Pro Gas Grill</a></h3>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001H9RPNI?tag=brobbq-gas-grill-200-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2235 alignright"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Char-Griller-3001-Grilling-Pro-Gas-Grill.jpg"" alt=""Char-Griller 3001 Grilling Pro Gas Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

The 3001 Grillin’ Pro is made by Char-Griller, a Georgia-based charcoal, and griller that produces Japanese style stoves and kettles as well.

This grill is very well built. The look and feel on it is kind of a barrel made grill, but it is very nice. You would think it is a rather more expensive grill. But the price point is just below $200.

It is a very capable grill, with a rather large cooking surface area and it also includes a warming rack with a side burner, so you can grill and cook a side dish at the same time. This is surely a grill you can do a lot on. It also has a side shelf that can be used as a handy workspace. Utensil hooks on the shelf will leave you all the free space that you need to prepare your food before cooking it. This grill is for the more heavy-duty grillers out there.

As we said, the build quality on it is very nice, with porcelain coated, cast iron cooking grates and a body made of steel which is powder coated for longtime outdoor use. This grill is built to last. It will withstand the test of weather and time, even when left out in the snow with no cover on.

This grill can deliver the power to heat up quite quickly and get you grilling in no time with its three big burners to cover all the grill space. The handle on the cover stays cool so you can easily check on how the grilling is going at any time.

But you will need to have plenty of room because this grill is not small. It is also on the heavy side at almost 90 pounds, so you probably won’t be moving it around that often.

The Classic 360 degree 3-Burner grill comes from Char-Broil which has been making grills and burners that use charcoal, gas, and electricity since 1948, so they have a lot of experience and definitely know what they’re doing.

We think this is a great 3-burner gas grill under $200. It is a stylish, very solid build in stainless steel and features porcelain-coated grates and burners, which makes it resistant to rust and is a lot less work to clean.

The main surface provides ample cooking surface area. It also has a swing-away rack that can be used for keeping food warm or as a secondary cooking area. The two metallic side shelves give you plenty of space for preparation while also holding your cooking utensils.

This inexpensive gas grill is a great one for the value. You could also get it with a side burner for cooking something at the same time as you’re grilling. The version with the side burner is listed at the same price, so it’s really a matter of which one you prefer.

Although it is not designed as portable equipment, this one is light enough to be loaded up into the back of your truck if you’re going camping. It’s also good as a starter grill, in case you’re not sure if you will really use this equipment that often and want to try one before investing in a more expensive one.

Let’s take a look at another interesting one. The grill from MasterCook is also an excellent outdoor gas grill under $200.

This model has a few things in common with the Char-Broil Classic 360 in terms of features and design. But, as you will see, there are also some important differences between the two.

It has a cooking surface area over which you can accommodate large meals. And affordable gas grill doesn’t have to mean cheaply constructed. This grill features wire cooking grates that have been coated with porcelain, a stainless steel handle, two foldable side shelves that can be used for prep space, a rack to keep food warm and two heavy duty 6-inch wheel casters for portability.

The lid and the firebox are built in stainless steel coated in porcelain and is made to stand up to tough weather. This product has been designed with an outdoor state of mind. It also has the capacity to heat up pretty quickly.

With all that being said, setting up this one can be a little tricky. Also, a few users are of the opinion that the starter unit often disappoints in terms of its promised functional ability.

Now for one that can be used for on-the-go grilling. This Liquid Propane Grill also comes from Char-Broil, so you know you’re getting a product built with all the knowledge and experience that this company has.

This is one of the best portable grills under $200 and is ideal for tailgating, camping or grilling at the beach. You just need a 1-pound propane gas tank to power up the single burner.

It only weighs 22 pounds and it has a carrying handle, which makes it easy to transport. It has a cooking surface area which is large enough to fit about 6 to 8 burger patties.

The body is built with painted porcelain and has sturdy legs allowing for it to be used on a table, on the ground or even at the beach.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-2980"" title=""Best gas grill under 200"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.-Best-gas-grill-under-200-502x1024.jpg"" alt=""Best gas grill under 200"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />

Choosing this equipment requires you to consider a few aspects. Generally speaking, while the price range of the products can vary widely, spending about $150 to $200 on a grill seems more than reasonable for all the features that you want.
<h3>Find out if it runs on natural gas or propane</h3>
When comparing prices check the fuel type your grill facilitates. Natural gas grills require a gas line at the grill location. Many of these are available in either configuration but running a propane grill on a natural gas and vice versa are not allowed.

You should consider getting a natural gas conversion kit priced between $50 to $100. Natural gas is hassle-free and less expensive than its counterpart.
<h3>Check the material</h3>
The ones under $200 are usually made of stainless steel, which is the preferred material for any professional cooking equipment. However, make sure that not only the body of the grill but also the frame are made of stainless steel and not materials such as cast aluminium.
<h3>Size should be determined by your grilling objectives</h3>
A decent sized grill with considerable cooking space is available under $200. Choose the size depending on how many people you are planning to cook for and in what quantity. The deciding factor should be based on convenience with a cooking surface area for grilling.
<h3>Gas Grills are safe, easy and convenient</h3>
Grills offer some benefits over charcoal grills. Gas grilling is extremely convenient. You have the ability to control the flame and temperature, at the turn of a knob. Gas grilling is also clean and quick. There is no messing around with briquettes, no handling of smelly starter fluid and no waiting around for the coals to get hot. In addition, once you’re done grilling, there are no ashes left behind to clean up. You simply turn it off and run a metal brush through it or stick the grates in the dishwasher and you’re done.

If it is convenience and cost-effectiveness that you’re after, then this kind of product is the right choice.","5 Best Gas Grills Under $200: Cheap & Inexpensive (%%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%)"

This beautiful grill is manufactured by Char-Broil. A very long time standing company that knows what they are doing when it comes to grills and smokers.

This is one of the more classic styled, powerful, mid-priced grills coming in right under $500.

The four burners deliver a lot of heating power across the spacious main cooking surface area. And we mean a lot of power. In terms of BTU, this is the most powerful grill on the market. It also has the largest cooking surface area, so it does need all that power.

This grill has it all in terms of features! In fact, it has some features that you may not even find in the more expensive grills.

The all metal grill with a stainless steel lid features a handle and panel for durability with a stylish look.

The spacious primary cooking surface area is made of porcelain coated cast iron grates. And in case its large size is not enough, it also has a swing-away secondary cooking surface also coated in porcelain.

In addition, it comes equipped with a side burner so you can cook your favorite side dishes and sauces while you’re grilling. If you need more preparation space, the side burner has a lid so it can double as a side panel.

Since the grill is very large and heavy it comes equipped with wheels in case you ever need to move it around.

There are two side panels which include a side burner that can be covered, doubling as use for extra working space. Hooks are provided to hang your cooking utensils as well.

But no two grills are exactly the same. Naturally, there are some differences. This grill is large, but not too heavy, so moving around shouldn’t be too much of a chore. It includes four wheels for this purpose.

<h2>So, what's the best gas grill under $500?</h2>
So we have covered the best Gas Grills under $500 that are available for purchase in 2018. We’ve gone from the grills that strongly favor style to grills that are more about performance.

All of these grills are budget-friendly, so you don’t have to break the bank to acquire a nice model fit to suit your grilling needs.

Determining the best grill under $500 for 2018 is really up to you. Make sure you make a list of the features you are wanting to best suit your needs before making a positive decision on a new grill.

We can tell you that <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC3UVDK?tag=brobbq-gas-grill-500-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">the Char-Broil four-burner</a> is a great grill for its value and contains lots of cooking space where you can grill for the whole family or at any gathering.

But of course, there other considerations to be taken into account such as space availability and mobility. The Char-Broil is not the best choice if you require a grill with these characteristics. In that case, you’d be better off with something like the Fuego Element grill.

We want to make sure you have all your ducks in a row and have been educated on all the details and functions before you make a decision on which grill to purchase. Whether it’s your first grill or if you are wanting to replace an older model, spend the time to research before you pull the trigger on the best gas grill under $500.
<h2>What Can You Expect from Gas Grills under $500?</h2>

Of course, you could always go with the classic charcoal grill. But there is so much more work that goes into charcoal grilling. You have to buy charcoal briquets and lighter fluid for everytime you grill. Plus in order to start the grill, you will have to wait about twenty minutes.

There will also be a lot of cleanups involved such as disposal of the grease and charcoal ash pans. With a gas grill, certain functions automatically trump the charcoal grill for convenience and time. One button to start with no waiting. One tank to be purchased for hours of grilling. And lastly, no cleanup.

Now don’t think that if you buy a cheaper grill you won’t have all the bells and whistles that come with an expensive grill. A grill with a reasonable price point can still feature a stylish design and withstand tough weather. Some of these grill options can also be space efficient and light.

Spending money on a bbq grill under 500 dollars will get you some of the most advanced gas grill models currently available. So, what are some of the things to consider when purchasing one? Let’s take a quick look:

<h2>Why Should You Buy a Portable Gas Grill?</h2>
Like we said, grilling is fun. If you’re here, you know that. But if you own a large, outdoor grill, you also know that those things are not the easiest to move around.

You can probably move it around in your house, take from the patio to your garage if you want to put it away, but if you ever want to go camping or hiking, then you know you will not be hauling that thing behind. And it probably won’t even fit in your car unless you have a large truck.

For those times when you’re out and about with your family or friends, but you still want to have delicious stakes, burgers and grilled vegetables, a portable grill is ideal.
<h3>Easy Fitting</h3>
Portable gas grills are easy to carry around, will fit almost anywhere and you can get a decent one even if you’re on a budget.
<h3>Extremely Versatile</h3>
Plus, they’re also versatile. Most of them can use either small, disposable propane tanks or the larger ones.

That means they’re not just good for when you want to carry them around, but also for when you’re constrained for space. You can use one of this on a boat, on your apartment balcony or your RV.

<h2>What Features to Look for in Your Portable Gas Grill?</h2>
Portable gas grills come with an array of features. You need to decide on which features are must in your unit and what you can probably do away with.

Now, your choice of a portable griller should be determined by factors like how frequent will you be using it, usually for how many people and so on. Accordingly, some of the features are:
<h3>Temperature Control</h3>
To maintain portability, the units usually have one temperature control. This is fine as long as you are choosing a single burner one. For those with 2 burners, two separate temperature controls are necessary to adjust accordingly.
<h3>Number of Burners</h3>
Well, portable grills with one burner can satisfactorily fulfill your grilling needs in a picnic and so on. However, if you wish to cook meat and vegetables together, it is wiser to go for the ones with 2 burners so that you can adjust the temperature for the desired result.
<h3>Grates Quality</h3>
The more quality made the grates are, the better will they be able to keep the heat in the cooking area. You have the option of choosing grates made of nickel, chrome, cast iron or stainless steel.
<h3>Cooking Area</h3>
Portable grills come with a range of cooking surface area with the standard being around 220-250 or less for some really portable ones. Go for one with a larger cooking surface if you are planning to use the unit often for picnic, tailgating and more of such outdoor uses.

The cart’s legs are foldable, so this makes this one the best portable gas grill for apartment balcony. After you use it, you can easily put it away. But don’t think you won’t be taking this one out.

This unit from Solitaire is definitely not cheap. As grill prices go, this will cost you more than some larger gas grills. But there is a reason for that. This is the most powerful grill in our list, and no doubt the first you’ll think when you see it is “Quality”.

The grill has a straightforward design. It has a commercial grade stainless steel construction that is all welded, so it’s very robust and there are no little hinge pieces that could come off.

It features V-shaped stainless steel grids, with infrared technology. This combination reduces flare-ups and keeps food flavor when it’s cooked. The grill provides lots of evenly-distributed heat, all the while remaining compact.

This certainly is a top-rated portable gas grill, with a burner design that is the same as the one used in restaurants. So, you’ll have professional quality, juicy food anywhere.

The unit is a super portable grill with a sturdy, ergonomic design and the performance that users of Weber grills have somewhat come to expect.

It has large grip and side handles and sturdy front and rear cradles, porcelain enameled cast iron cooking grates that heat up quickly and cook evenly. The body and lid are made of durable, light-weight cast aluminum.

The grates are split, so you can remove one and, with the right griddle, you can have a grate/griddle cooking combination. However, the absence of a thermometer for temperature control can be a bit difficult especially, for the beginners.

The weight and size of this grill are definitely meant for portability. But even though it is designed to be moved around, like the other portable grills featured in this list, it can be adapted to be used with larger gas tank. This little grill is also the perfect portable grill for RV.

2358,"How To Use A Smoker Grill In 8 Steps With Pictures","Having read about what a smoker grill is all about, how about some knowledge on how to use it?

Smoking or grilling meat are two of the best ways for cooking meat; smoking takes a slow and longer cooking approach in doing this but retains smoky flavors in the food through indirect heat.

Grilling, on the hand, locks in flavoring spices in the meat and cooks it faster through direct heat.
Explore further to know how to use a smoker grill.
<h2><a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-grill-smoker-combo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1. Get a smoker grill</a></h2>
First things first, you will need a smoker grill to start off with. Our review shares a guide on what to look out for when getting one. You can choose from the list of smoker grills shared too or any other that suits your needs.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-2364 alignnone"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Get-a-smoker-grill.jpg"" alt=""Get a smoker grill"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>2. Prepare your smoker grill</h2>
Fill the firebox with charcoal pieces and light them. Soak wood chippings (without chemicals) in water for 30 minutes and then add the soaked wood unto the lighted coals to smoke up the grill.

Preheat the equipment to a temperature of 400 °F and then reduce it to 225 °F to 250 °F when ready to start cooking.

This allows the grill to be uncontaminated and ready to use.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2365"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Prepare-your-smoker-grill.jpg"" alt=""Get a smoker grill"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>3. Create moisture and extra flavoring for your meat.</h2>
Pour water into a hard foil bowl, and add a few herbs and spices to it. Place this bowl under the grill grate, directly under the meat (which will be on the grill grate).

This process will create moist for the meat and will also aid in sitting in the smoky and spice flavors from the wood chippings. It is a rare trick for getting juicy flavored meat.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2366"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Create-moisture-and-extra-flavoring-for-your-meat.jpg"" alt=""Create moisture and extra flavoring for your meat"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>4. Get the meat on.</h2>
Place your marinated meat on the grill grate over the spiced water, ensure temperatures are between 225 °F to 250 °F depending on the level of doneness you are expecting to achieve, and the size of the meat.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2367"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Get-the-meat-on.jpg"" alt=""Get the meat on"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>5. Close the lid</h2>
Afterwards, close the grill and leave the meat to cook. Leave food to cook for 1 to 1 ½ hours per pound. Keep the lid closed during this period to maintain a consistent temperature.

Opening the lid while cooking will cause heat loss which could affect the doneness of the food.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2368"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Close-the-lid.jpg"" alt=""Close the lid"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>6. Control temperatures</h2>
Regulate airflow while cooking to control temperatures using the dampers at the top and bottom of the grill. Opening the upper damper will release air from the grill and will reduce the temperature while opening the lower damper will allow more air to the fire and increase the heat.

You can also adjust airflow by how wide or narrow you open each damper.
<h3>Upper damper</h3>
<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2369"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Control-temperatures.jpg"" alt=""Control temperatures"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

&nbsp;
<h2>7. Check food and fuel</h2>
Open the lid and check food every once an hour. Use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of the food ensuring that the internal temperatures of the food are right. This is also a good time to refill the water basin under the food if necessary, and also, add some more fuel into the smoker box if the food is not done yet.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2371"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Check-food-and-fuel.jpg"" alt=""Check food and fuel"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>8. Clean and serve</h2>
Once the meat is ready, remove it and place it aside to cool.

Clean the grill grate while still warm with a steel brush. Both options help with an easier clean.

Serve the food when cooled slightly and enjoy!

<h2>Tips and tricks for getting the best of your smoker grill</h2>
Your smoke grill can last you a long time with food always turning out at the right level of doneness and flavors. You, however, will need to know a few things to make these happen:
<h3>Always prepare your grill before usage</h3>
- Preheat your grill always before cooking.
- After, adjust the heat to your desired temperature for cooking.
<h3>Choose the best form of fuel for the perfect result</h3>
- Always use brand new charcoal pieces when making your fire. Previously used charcoal will burn down too quickly which will affect the temperatures when cooking.

- Use the right kind of wood - you can ask the butcher for the best options to use, they know better.

- Enhance the aroma of your food with flavored woods. You can find them in various flavors, eg; cherry, apple cider, maple, oak amongst others. Choose the best flavor that sits well with you.
<h3>Little trick on managing temperatures</h3>
- Start cooking with low fire to high fire to build up the right temperatures needed.
- Always have a bottle of water near you to quench wide spreading fires in your firebox.
<h3>Getting the best of your food</h3>
- Leave all the fat on the meat when grilling, they will melt and drip into the fire which will create good smoke to improve the flavor of the meat.

- When searing meat, allow the grill grate to sear the meat on one side fully, then flip the meat and repeat. This will create a beautiful look on the meat.
<h3>Save the grates and grill from rust</h3>
- Inasmuch you may want to retain some flavors in your smoker grill, debris and grease may gather at the bottom. Clean it once every few times to avoid it.

- Oil the bottom and outer parts of your grill with vegetable oil after cleaning it to avoid rust.

These grills are small and light enough for you to take them with you anywhere. Camping, tailgating, anything. Take it with you on your fishing trip and you can cook your catch right there.

Whether you already own a large grill, or just want to purchase your first grill, a small grill might be something to look into. Let’s take a look at the complete reviews of some of these.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3007"" title=""BEST SMALL GAS GRILLS"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/9.-BEST-SMALL-GAS-GRILLS-502x1024.jpg"" alt=""small gas bbq grills"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />
<h2>Is a Small Gas Grill as Smart Investment?</h2>
A full-sized grill can be an oasis of features. If you’re a serious griller, you might feel that you can only get a good grilling out of one of those full-sized grills. But that might not be true.

Small propane grills have become so rich in features that they can almost replace larger grills. And there’s even a plus. Something you can do with a tiny grill that you can’t do with a large one: take it with you anywhere.
<h3>Light Weight and Portability</h3>
Full-sized grills are usually heavy, so you wouldn’t think of loading one up in your car and take it on a camping trip. Maybe it wouldn’t even fit your car, unless you drive a large pick-up truck.

And even then, carrying all that weight might be cumbersome, at the very least. Also, you might have just a small backyard with your studio apartment and not too much of space to set up an elaborate barbecue.

That’s where mini gas grills come in. They’re large enough for use in your backyard, but small enough that you can actually carry them around.
<h3>Standard Features and Build Quality</h3>
Unlike the common misconception that being smaller in size implies less potential, compact gas grills can actually be as powerful as the larger ones. And they don’t really compromise in features or build quality.
<h3>Cost-Effective</h3>
Besides, small bbq grills are never as costly as larger grills, they're much cheaper. So, they’re perfect if you’re just curious about grilling and are not sure if it’s really the thing for you, or if you just don’t want to spend too much money.

They do make good grills and this one is light enough to be easily portable.

We think this is a great mid-size gas grill. It is stylish and very solidly built and has two stainless steel in-line burners, which provide great cooking performance.

The lid and grates are made of steel and are porcelain coated, which makes them durable and easy to clean and also prevents food from sticking.

The main surface provides ample cooking space. It also has two metallic side shelves that give you plenty of space for preparation or for keeping your cooking utensils.

Two out of its four feet have 6-inch wheels for easy transportation, and the other two are fixed, for stability.

This is a fine grill at a very reasonable price, with the added benefit of portability. The only problem while transporting the unit is that the side shelves do not fold.

Overall, it’s great as a starter grill, in case you’re not sure if you will really use a gas grill that often or perhaps want to try one before investing in a more expensive model.

A one is tiny enough to become top-rated small camping grill that you will take on your camping trips or when you go picnicking and the name is pretty much suggestive of its USP too.

But you can also use this grill right in your backyard or in your apartment balcony. So, really, we’re looking at quite a versatile little grill out there.

You’ll almost feel like you’re grilling in a full-sized grill when you use the Coleman. The cooking surface is large enough for ten burger patties, so you can cook dinner for up to six people at a time. Not bad.

The cooking grids are made of porcelain coated cast iron, and they heat up really fast. They can be swapped for griddle or stove grates, giving you the possibility to cook different kinds of food at once.

It even has two side shelves for putting your cooking utensils or to use as cutting boards. The grill gets its cooking power from the two independent burners and being independent, they give you the chance to easily control the temperature.

The foldable design of the unit is super convenient. It’s great for when you’re taking it camping or for when you want to store it away, ensuring it won’t be in your way if you’re a little constrained for space.

Since the grids are coated with porcelain, cleaning them is fairly easy. In fact, since the grill is so small, cleaning the whole thing should not take too much time.

This one again comes from Char-Broil, so you know you’re getting a quality product built with materials of top quality, and with all the knowledge and experience that this company has in manufacturing these units.

This grill features a design that favors function rather than style. And that is fine, because it is strong and feels well-built and sturdy and will surely have no trouble to take some roughness out on these trips with you.

The lid is built in painted porcelain, and it has sturdy steel legs which provide a lot of stability. These legs cannot be folded or removed, however, so whenever you’re transporting it, the legs will be sticking out, which also means it takes more storage space.

The cooking surface, with a porcelain coated wire grate, is large enough for eight burgers, or two to three steaks. You and your family will not go hungry in those camping trips and you’ll be able to monitor the temperature at all times with the included thermometer.

Because of its size, the Char-Broil can only feature one single burner, but the lid has some depth, meaning that the heat will flow inside and you should have no problem cooking your food.

All in all, this grill has good quality, is easy to use and campers and hikers will appreciate its rugged design too.

But it has such a small and interesting design, that we wanted to include it here.

The Fuego Element model will definitely stand out during all those BBQs with friends and family, and it will look great in your backyard or deck.

The grill looks and is very compact, but don’t let it fool you. Even with its small footprint, it has a large cooking surface with a porcelain enameled cast iron cooking grate.

With its powerful burners, this grill can reach high temperatures in no time. And its design is not just about how it looks, it’s also about providing balanced heat when cooking through the use of two circular burner and semi-spherical cover, which allows the heat to flow evenly inside.

Since it’s very compact, it’s also very light, and it can be moved around easily using the included wheels, which also lock when you need to provide stability.

Its small size also makes it the perfect grill if you are a little bit space-constrained: if you have a small patio or for use on a small balcony. The lack of cover is, however, a real problem that might make it a little vulnerable when being carried outdoors.

2533,"How To Use A Gas Grill: Learn In A Step-By-Step Guide","If you are a grill enthusiast, always waiting for an opportunity to cook up delicious and soft pieces of meat and veggies, it is necessary that you know best how to use a gas grill too. So, here, let’s embark on a step-by-step journey to understand the exact ways of using a gas grill.

Before digging into how to use a gas grill, you need to get the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-gas-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best gas grill</a> that is suitable for you
<h2>1. Checking your fuel supply and grease management system</h2>
When you feel like ready to grill, always begin by verifying your fuel supply to ensure you have enough. It is also recommended in this step to take a look to some safety tips before using your gas tank.
For instance, always verify that the gas has no outside damage (bumps, cracks or holes). It is also important make sure there is no leak in the gas system: by applying a little soapy water to the hoses and joints, you can easily make sure that the gas system is completely sealed; if you don’t observe any bubble, you are ready to use your gas tank.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2559 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Checking-your-fuel-supply-and-grease-management-system.jpg"" alt=""Checking your fuel supply and grease management system"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>2. Make sure grilling items are in place</h2>
Remove any other items that you won’t be using at the moment of verification to be completely sure that everything is fine and ready to use on your grill. It is always good to have all these items in one place and make sure they are going to be ready just when you need them after the verification.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2563 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Make-sure-grilling-items-are-in-place.jpg"" alt=""Make sure grilling items are in place"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>3. Preparing the food items</h2>
After the verification of your grill it will be a good time to prepare your food items (cooking utensils and the food to be prepared), it is important to have all food items fully prepared and ready to go before you begin; so you can enjoy your grilling experience.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2565 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Preparing-the-food-items.jpg"" alt=""Preparing the food items"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>4. Pre-heating by putting the burner on high</h2>
One main step will be to pre-heat your grill, by turning all burners on high and closing the hood for 15-20 minutes; this step is really important to maintain a stable temperature so your food can be prepared evenly and turns out to be delicious.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2564 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pre-heating-by-putting-the-burner-on-high.jpg"" alt=""Pre-heating by putting the burner on high"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>5. Checking the usage of oil on the cooking grids</h2>
When you make sure that the grill is enough pre-heated, you can start to lightly coat your cooking grids with oil; then close the lid. After closing the lid you need to set your control knobs to your desired cooking temperature.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2558 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Checking-the-usage-of-oil-on-the-cooking-grids.jpg"" alt=""Checking the usage of oil on the cooking grids"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>6. With more than one burner</h2>
Talking about grills with more than one burner, it is highly recommended to set a hot side and a warm side.
It is highly recommended to set one side of your grill to medium hot or hot as desired; and the other side to medium low or medium; to have two different options while grilling; depending on the food you are cooking and your taste of food.
The preparation of the sides lets you sear on one side of your grill and finish cooking a well prepared dish on the other side. It also provides a safe place for you to move the food just in case the hot side starts to get too hot to handle.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2569 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/With-more-than-one-burner.jpg"" alt=""With more than one burner"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>7. Start with the Grilling Procedure</h2>
In order to grill as an expert, always keep consistency really simple by placing food on the grill from left to right and back to front. Before turning your first side up give one or two items a little nudge, if they don't want to release they are probably not ready to be turned.
Let them cook for another minute or two depending on the temperature and your taste of food. When they are ready, just continue the left to right back to front order when flipping and removing the food you are cooking.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2566 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Start-with-the-Grilling-Procedure.jpg"" alt=""Start with the Grilling Procedure"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>8. Keep the Hood Closed</h2>
As much as you like the sensation of heat while grilling it is way better to keep your hood closed as much as possible, your food will cook faster, more evenly, with a better flavor and is going to be safer for you.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2562 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Keep-the-Hood-Closed.jpg"" alt=""Keep the Hood Closed"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>9. Get ready a cast iron pot or skillet</h2>
It is really useful to have on hand a cast iron pot or skillet especially if you are planning on making quick sauces, boiling marinades, or warming dessert toppings. They heat evenly and their extra weight keeps them more stable on the grill.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2561 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Get-ready-a-cast-iron-pot-or-skillet.jpg"" alt=""Get ready a cast iron pot or skillet"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>10. Tent food with foil to rest</h2>
When your food is ready, remove it from the grill and proceed to tent with foil to rest; this step is done to preserve the food temperature so you can enjoy all the flavor of your food.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2567 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tent-food-with-foil-to-rest.jpg"" alt=""Tent food with foil to rest"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>11. ""Burn-off"" your grill</h2>
While resting, it is really important to ""burn-off"" your grill; by setting all burners to high, closing the hood, and allowing your grill to burn off the excess residue.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2557 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Burn-off-your-grill.jpg"" alt=""Burn-off your grill"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>12. Turn off the grill and lightly brush off any excess</h2>
Once the grill stops smoking, turn it off and lightly brush off any excess with a wire brush; this step is also important since you don’t want to mix food flavor in your next grilling session.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2568 size-full"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Turn-off-the-grill-and-lightly-brush-off-any-excess.jpg"" alt=""Turn off the grill and lightly brush off any excess"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />
<h2>13. Final wipe with oil</h2>
Finally, give your grids another light wipe with oil and your grill will be ready the next time you want to grill.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-2560 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Final-wipe-with-oil.jpg"" alt=""Final wipe with oil"" width=""800"" height=""448"" />

<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks of Using a Gas Grill</h2>
So, now that you are aware of the steps involved in the process of cooking up some great meals, here are some more tips and tricks of using a gas grill in the most desired manner.
<ul>
 	<li>Prepare your meat for grilling well beforehand through marinades and rub recipes. It will add to the flavor when grilled</li>
 	<li>When grilling burgers and patties, avoid pressing them down for the sizzling sound or flipping them too many times. The less you touch, the more juices they will retain, promising a taste that stays with you for long</li>
 	<li>With ribs and steak, go for slow cooking and try to keep the meat a little bit away from the direct flames</li>
 	<li>No matter how hungry and anxious you are, wait for a good 10 minutes after the grilling is done to let the meat reabsorb the juices and get as tender and delicious as you want it to be</li>
</ul>
Last but not the least, always make sure engaging in safe grilling. So, keep a fire extinguisher at hand or around the spot to prevent rare but accidental situations from arising.

2539,"5 Best Natural Gas Grills For The Money (July 2018 Updated)","Grilling is a fun activity that you traditionally do in your backyard or your deck, gathered with friends or family. That’s what the best natural gas grills are great for. Good, old-fashioned backyard grilling.

They’re not really meant to be moved around all the time, although some of them might have some of the characteristics of portable grills. Let’s take a look to see what these units can offer you with.

We’ve selected a few great ones and hopefully you’ll be able to choose which one is for you. So, here you go.

<h2>Is Choosing a Natural Gas Grill a Wise Option?</h2>
If you decide to go with gas for your grilling experience, you should know that gas grills come in two flavors: propane and natural gas. Natural gas grills have certain pros and a few drawbacks too, which you must be aware of before deciding on the brand or model etc.
<h3>Increased Convenience</h3>
These units work by virtue of direct lines to the grill and this set up is way more convenient than the propane powered one any day. There is no risk of running out of fuel as you can access as much of natural gas you need to cook up a tasty meal.
<h3>More Economical</h3>
If you are a grill master in the true sense, whipping up a BBQ every now and then, this one using natural gas can save a lot of your costs. The natural ones are supposed to be operating at 1/6th of the cost of propane.

In fact, with natural gas, the fun part is the more frequent you are using the grill; the less will be your monthly expenditure because you are making the most of the available resource. One refill of a propane tank costs you higher than a monthly gas bill for sure.
<h3>Care for the Environment</h3>
There’s no point harming the environment in the process of serving ourselves with tasty foods. With a natural gas one, you have lesser carbon dioxide emissions while the entire process remains cleaner as well.
<h2>Is Natural Gas Grill Without a Drawback?</h2>
Well, each option has its cons and a natural gas unit is not without any. These can be a little difficult to set up, not to mention that the upfront costs can be on the higher side too.

The supply line of the gas is fixed and hence, you can never move around the unit unlike portable ones. But that being said, if you are most comfortable grilling at your place, then either the installation or the immobility shouldn’t be a problem at all.

We say, go ahead and give them a try. They might just be the right grilling solution for you. Otherwise, you can refer more to <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-gas-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">other types of gas grills</a>, we think you'll find the right one for you

This grill amazingly blends style and function in the most desired manner.

It has a sleek design, with stainless steel shroud, door and burners and porcelain enameled cast-iron cooking grates, which are easy to clean and require no seasoning. The cook box is made of cast aluminum, meaning it’s durable and requires minimal maintenance.

It has a large main cooking surface, and a necessary warming rack. It also features two side shelves, which give you enough room to prepare your food and hang your utensils although raising or lowering them is not as smooth as they should be.

The grill comes with Weber’s own invention: Flavorizer Bars system, which catches drippings and vaporizes them to add more flavor to your food. Whatever drippings are not vaporized are drained out.

Connecting this grill to the gas line is easy, with its 10-foot hose.

Weber’s advanced technologies are also evident in this grill. It includes Weber’s Flavorizer Bars for food with an extra touch of flavor and a new grease management system, which reduces the risk of flare-ups.

However, the price, too, is on the higher side though it often seems justified compared to all the features incorporated in this model.

Napoleon is a well-known brand and it is well-known for producing some high-quality models striking the right balance of robustness and technological innovations. Their grills go from mid-range to upper range.

This high-end model has six burners, which are responsible for all the power this grill can deliver. The construction is all in stainless steel, including the side shelves, which you can use as working space with the included cutting board, as a cooler, as a condiment storage space, or as a side burner.

Apart from the six burners, the grill also has a rear infrared burner. So, in one grill, you have the possibility to go from searing to baking like and oven to rotisserie roasting, all the while you’re making your favorite sauce on the side burner and your friends and family are enjoying cold drinks right out of the ice box.

It also has some little touches: for example, the control knobs are backlit, which just makes it look really cool and sophisticated and adds to the general feel of quality this grill has.

This is one true versatile grill and one of the best outdoor natural grills out there. If you have free reign on your spending, this is definitely a great high- quality grill to go for.

It has a double-wall firebox with five stainless steel burners that deliver lots of power over an ample cooking surface. There are three heavy gauge cooking grates, also in stainless steel.

The unit comes with a side burner, for side dishes and sauces, and infrared rotisserie burners, so you’ll have more cooking options.

A triple fueling grill; propane, charcoal, and wood chips is also a step further from many other dual fueling grills on the market.

This propane charcoal grill combo produces at least 38 burgers on its 1,060 square inches of cooking surface area. Each separate fueling unit can be used at the same time, so you are guaranteed to feed a sizeable party.

It is constructed of 6 porcelain coated wire cooking grates on the charcoal grill, three 3 burners on the gas grill, an added metal bottom shelf with plenty of space for keeping utensils and an attached thermometer.

The grill grates are removable and dishwasher-safe making it effortless to clean.
At an average cost of $400, this is a cool option with a 2-year warranty offering.

The highest priced combo on our list, averaging at $1000. Let see what it’s got!

It offers 4 sections for cooking - a gas grill, charcoal grill, a 10,000 BTU side burner and an offset woodbox for searing. This gives you many different grilling options and enough space to make food when cooking.

Also, switching between grilling options is made easy with its build which makes it easy to use by everyone.

Its construction is quite sizeable, so this does not take up a lot of space. However, it is heavy weighing in at 218 lbs. but comes with 4 locking casters to support mobility and stability.

With 860 square inches of cooking surface area, this gas and charcoal hybrid grill produces a decent amount of food (about 20 burgers which is alright for a medium sized get-together).

Like many other 2-tier combos with some competitive features, the Dyna - Glo has both the gas grill and charcoal function and an attached bottle opener.

With collapsible side tables, it is the only hybrid gas charcoal grill on this list that provides extra space for working. This saves you the energy from going back and forth to prepare foods.

Weighing in at 143 lbs. it comes with 2 casters and 2 wheels for mobility, however, this does not mean that it can be moved around easily. Its material makes up may be worrying as it is prone to quick rusts. The trick is to change its parts frequently to ensure a more extended usage.

The grill grates are amazing as they lock in food juices just as well. They are easy to clean, and grease traps can be easily pulled out.

It comes with a 1-year warranty.

There are hood mounted thermometers installed in each cooking chamber that is easily regulated. This makes it user-friendly and comfortable to use by any beginner.

On the downside, the 5050 Duo is constructed of materials poorly chosen, hence you are likely to be replacing parts.

However, you will find it to be easily assembled with clear manufacturer’s guidance which is also, easily cleanable after use.

Averagely costing at a half of thousand dollars, this can be said to be a decent buy.

This is the smallest sized combo grill on our list and we have chosen this for its small cooking size. It is the ideal combo for a small family weighing at only 96 lbs. with a total of three 40,000 BTU primary burners and one 12,000 BTU side burner.

This very simple designed grill is basically a gas grill with a specially designed charcoal pan that is inserted into the gas grill. This is the convertible option from gas to charcoal but both are not able to be used at the same time and is perfect for entry-level users.
While the Char-Broil is one of the most inexpensive, it does not mean that it is poorly constructed or cheap by any means. Anyone on a very tight budget would be perfect using this grill.

The Char-Broil company offers a 5-year warranty on its burners and 1-year warranty on every other part. This is a good deal for its make.

<h2>Digging deeper: Why to buy a propane-charcoal grill combo?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-2988"" title=""Best gas charcoal combo grill"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5.-Best-gas-charcoal-combo-grill-502x1024.jpg"" alt=""Best gas charcoal combo grill"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />
<h3>Dual and more options</h3>
This device has the best of both worlds all in one. You get to have the gas grill which is easy to use and perfect for cold weather and the charcoal grill for smoky flavors which is ideal for warm climates.

You will not need to worry about getting great results or worry about space for storing both gas and charcoal grills in the name of versatility. These inventions solve both needs at once.

There is no use buying separate pieces of equipment which are single functional for grilling your foods because:
<ol>
 	<li>They are not great value for money.</li>
 	<li>They yield to time wastage in the long run.</li>
 	<li>They reduce the options of flavor that you can make.</li>
</ol>
These machines provide you with both options and in some versions can sear, smoke and roast food - all in one device! It is the trendiest solution for the problems mentioned above and therefore should be a priority to save you the stress.
<h3>Your space is precious</h3>
There is nothing like having a spacious backyard. Apart from the fact that it has a clean look, it is also healthy for the soul.

Jam-packing your backyard with different types of cooking equipment is not a good look and you should avoid this.

This is why this invention came to be. It fits all the different grilling options into one and is made with unique designs to give your space that modern and fresh look.
<h3>Make more food</h3>
Investing in future needs is one of the wisest things you can do and invest in these combos are no exception.

They give you multiple spaces to cook enough food that will serve medium to large sized parties. Nature will always bless you with an opportunity to share and celebrate, and these combination gas and charcoal grills will be the best support for this.

They will make you fantastic food in larger quantities than they would with singular purposed devices.

Do not compromise on this, you will thank us soon.
<h3>Spend wisely</h3>
Little drops of water make a mighty ocean so, little drops of money on the wrong cooking equipment will lead to mighty wastage. Ignore your fleshy cravings in order to save money on time.

Multi-purpose machines may seem like a large sum at the first price look, but with just a little calculation you will realize that gas charcoal smoker and grill combos usually save you by 20% or more on cost.

Manage your pocket well with these!
<h2>What should you then look for in your purchase?</h2>
<h3>Does it use at least propane and charcoal?</h3>
These devices should have a combination of either gaseous propane or liquid propane, and charcoal for fueling. If they offer other fuel sources like wood pellet fueling, it is a consideration. Ensure to check that these offerings are available and have kind words for its versatile functionality.

Gas grills are used for faster cooking and more comfortable to clean but do not give off the traditional smokey flavor in foods that charcoal grills do. Charcoal grills instead require you to have some compelling skills for lighting coals and can be harder to clean.

Having the backyard dual gas and charcoal grill makes life more relaxing as you can switch from one to the other or use both at the same time.
<h3>Consider your food size turnout</h3>
Most of these dual function grill combos are made to produce food for at least ten people in one round. However, this could still be a small number.

Take a scan through your lifestyle and make a purchase that will serve the needs of medium to large sized servings based on your calculations of what you will entertain.

We can recommend looking out for hybrid grills with a total cooking surface area of at least 400 square inches and on the gas grill with at least two burners.
<h3>What is the quality of make?</h3>
Before making a purchase, do a good research on what materials the gas and charcoal hybrid grill is made of just so you do not have a combo that is rusting 3 months down the line.

Two of the best elements to look out for are stainless steel and porcelain. These are not easily corroded and will withstand the test of weather changes.

Make sure to invest in a cover which will protect its durability even further.
<h3>Is it a rip-off?</h3>
Again, conduct enough research and compare pricing with various sales outlets as much as you can. The best dual fuel grills vary in cost according to their makes, but this does not mean a dash of cash on poor quality. One of the goals for these inventions is to save the customer cost so be keen on this.

There are a few brands out there that are pricey based solely on name reputation that has been built, do not get carried away by this.","5 Best Gas (Propane) Charcoal Combo Grills (%%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%)"

It is perfect if you want to become a barbecue master and deliver amazing food for your party. It is not only the grill but also its premium features which include porcelain-coated cast iron grates and top-ported 443 Stainless steel burners which make this 2 burner infrared gas grill perfect for anyone.

The cooking system allows you to cook with a greater temperature control using infrared technology. The Infrared heat is powered by its 2 Top Ported 443 Stainless steel burners helping to prevent hot and cold spots on the grill’s surface using less gas.

Infrared grilling has become a trend for 2018 in outdoor cooking. An infrared grill comes with infrared technology as the main source of heat.

In a regular gas grill, the flame heats the grates directly but in an infrared grill, there is an infrared element between the grates and the flame.

So how does an infrared system work? Well, the answer is that the gas heats the infrared element which then radiates intense heat. Grill experts confirm that infrared grills are the best for searing meat, providing uniform heat and cutting down on flare-ups.

Not only does it have 2 amazing infrared burner systems but also has a large and strong stainless steel door that protects the gas tank and allows additional storage of many items like wood chips, grill tools, sauces, and rubs.

The grill sits on 4 casters, two of which lock, for increased mobility and stability. With the increasing popularity of natural gas grills, this amazing grill can easily convert from liquid propane (lp) to natural gas (ng) with a natural gas conversion kit.

It has an easy to read, lid mounted temperature gauge to monitor temperature. The Steel lid and firebox stand have durable porcelain coating to stand up to any weather condition. Furthermore, there are folding side shelves, allowing this spectacular grill to give you the power to be a master griller.

Let’s take a look at another great grill manufactured by a very well-known brand. While this grill is a smaller size, it was created to have some premium functions featured on larger scale grills.

What does that mean for you? You receive a grill that is not only designed for durability but also great to travel with. For the money, it’s the best Kamado grill option.

While you are able to cook a decent amount of food on this grill, it won’t be the best choice if you’re going to be cooking for more than four people. Because of its size, it’s best for smaller families and small gatherings.
This does not mean that this is not a good quality unit. It’s definitely been built to last with durable, lightweight material and designed to produce great cooking results, enhance flavor and lock smoke into whatever you’re grilling.

It also holds heat really well which means you’ll be using less charcoal. It has dual flow dampers which allow for easier and better temperature control. Also, the grill has a hinged locking lid, a heat gauge and thick-walled insulation which are all features you would normally see on the best charcoal grills.

The walls are made with 22-gauge steel which can maintain higher temperatures than those made with alternative materials. Using the dual dampers allows the temperature to be adjusted with accuracy, letting you go from very high to very low temperatures.

While most models of this size have stainless steel grates, this grill has cast iron grates. The cast iron is extremely thick which is the best for heat retention. Although it adds weight, it also ensures durability. With proper care, you’ll probably never have to replace the grates.

All of these features are available on a unit that can also be easily loaded up on a truck and taken on the road. All that you would need to bring along is a bag of charcoal and you’d be ready for a camping party.

This value Kamado grill which is just as good as some premium-priced models, is elegantly well constructed to mimic the big green egg. This big green egg look-alike is not so much a knockoff as it is an alternative.

It’s predecessor, the first classic model, introduced a unique multilevel grate and heat deflection system called “Divide and Conquer” which also comes as a standard feature on this model.

The system consists of multi-level half-racks that double the cooking surface area. This makes it easier to create different cooking zones with the ability to cook food on different levels and cooking surfaces.

It has an all aluminum, no rust top vent to maintain airflow consistently and precise. It also comes with a double-thick wire mesh fiberglass gasket for a superior air-tight seal.

It also includes two side shelves, hooks for your utensils, a thermometer and an easy to access ash pan.

<h2>What is the Kamado Style All About?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-2969"" title=""Best Kamado Grills"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/20.-Best-kamado-grill-Done-470x1024.png"" alt=""Best Kamado Grills"" width=""300"" height=""653"" />

Kamados grills are perfect for residential use. They are fueled by charcoal and are modern versions of the Chinese and Indian earthenware cooking ovens that were first used several thousand years ago.

Yes, they kind of look like giant eggs, hence why so of them are called big green eggs. They are made of ceramic or refractory materials which are the same materials that are used to make kilns, crucibles, and pizza ovens. These materials are chosen because of their ability to retain and radiate heat effectively.

With that being said, Ceramic Kamado grills are becoming more and more popular in the grilling world.
<h2>Why Buying a Kamado Grill is a Good Decision?</h2>
Ceramic cookers are well insulated which allows the interior to absorb and radiate heat evenly, making them very good at holding steady temperatures. Once you get a Kamado cooker started and bring it to the desired temperature, the grill will maintain the temperature during the entire cooking process.. Kamados can be especially useful if you live in a colder climate or if you want to cook outdoors in the winter.

Because ceramic is prone to cracking, some designs are built using modern fiber insulation clad in a steel casing. Although, each material has its strengths and weaknesses.

Some cooks prefer the heat retention of ceramic over the steel models. On the other hand, steel doesn’t crack or rust.
<h3>Excellent Grilling Procedure</h3>
Kamados grills have the ability to get really hot which is great for searing thin meats like skirt steak that you want to cook fast. The problem that arises when Kamado grills get hot, is that they take forever to cool down making it difficult to create a two-zone setup. This is why many people think kamados work better as smokers and ovens than as grills.

If you’re interested in getting some serious grilling done on one of these, then you’ll need a design that allows you to have two-zone cooking.
<h2>What Type of Charcoal is Suitable?</h2>
It is recommended by some manufacturers to use more expensive lump charcoal rather than briquettes. Supposedly, briquettes produce more ashes than lump charcoal and the ash can block the airflow as it builds up. However, some Kamado manufacturers produce their own lump charcoal, so their interests may just lie there.

Generally, we recommend using briquettes in charcoal burners because they’re affordable, consistent, and readily available. Lump charcoal, especially the bargain-basement varieties, can be inconsistent and inefficient. Some bags of Lump charcoal are liable to have pulverized charcoal dust or large chunks of construction material. It's not unusual to find metal and plastic debris mixed in.

It’s best to use high-quality lump charcoal with a Kamado style grill because it is easier to stir the charcoal while it sits at the bottom of the firebox.","5 Best Kamado Grills For The Money (%%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%)"

Let’s take a look to see if an infrared grill is right for you, and if you already know you want one, then let us help you decide on the best.

<h2>Why is an Infrared Grill a Suitable Choice for You?</h2>
An infrared grill is one that has a burner that produces infrared radiation. This is different to standard grills that cook food using a convection system. That is, the heat flows around the food through the air.

The mechanism that goes into these units allows it to have certain advantages over gas or charcoal grills.
<h3>Enables Consistent Cooking</h3>
Infrared grills use radiant heat, which does not require air to travel; it can travel through a vacuum. The way the Earth is heated by the sun is an example of radiant heat.

This means that infrared grills can produce a very consistent cooking area, regardless of the surrounding temperature.
<h3>Quite Fuel Efficient</h3>
Infrared cooking maximizes flavor, saves on fuel and is much more convenient than standard grills. Not all infrared grills are fueled by gas because as technology advances, some electrical models have been created too.
<h3>Tastier Food with Retained Moisture</h3>
The moisture in food is also better retained by using infrared cooking, since standard grills cannot easily penetrate the moisture boundary present in food without disrupting it. When that happens, the food dries out because of hot air.

Infrared heat easily penetrates the moisture barrier without breaking it apart. The result is that the cooked food is a lot juicier than food cooked with convection cooking systems.

So, if you want evenly cooked ribs, or want to roast a turkey, this is the product for you.

It can hold up to 25 pounds for roasting. For added flavor when cooking, you can use the smoker box with wood chips or pellets.

The infrared technology, which is the same in all units of this brand makes it less prone to flare-ups and cooks food more evenly.

The use of the fire box will allow you to cook food with many flavors, since different types of wood chips have different flavors. You can smoke your food using only that part of the unit.

The especially designed propane burner is located between the outer and inner wall of the grill, so the heat fully encloses everything that is inside and escapes through the top chamber. Naturally, this also contributes to more thoroughly cooked food, as the heat does not come from only one direction.

This helps keep the food’s moisture and keeps it tender, while the cooking time is nine minutes on average, which is faster than most other models.

The temperatures it achieves can range from simmer to sear. The flow of hot air is limited in this grill.

Instead, it uses more radiant heat to get the job done. This reduces cold or overly hot spots which can cause your food to burn.

The technology for electric ones has advanced a lot in recent years, and they work even better with infrared technology.

Now you can use your electric grill and get the same results you would on a traditional one.

A little assembly is required to get this model up and running. The work required is not too excessive, but still a little more than other grills on the market as it will take you about 30 to 45 minutes.

Once it’s set up, the unit looks and feels amazing. Everything on it says its top quality. You’ll immediately get the sense that the grill is going to last you a long time.

There are no delicate parts or anything like that.

Since this one is electric, you’ll never need to worry about running out of fuel in the middle of a grilling session, as long as you have electricity, of course. It runs from any normal outlet, so you just plug it in, turn it on and wait a few moments to start cooking.

The unit uses Infrared technology and this allows for a better distribution of heat. The food is heated in such a way that it is not so easily burnt on the outside, so moisture and flavor are retained.

This technology also allows for the heat to penetrate more easily, which means everything is cooked evenly.

Of course, this grill can also be used if you live in a condo or an apartment where cooking with charcoal or using certain gas appliances may be restricted or prohibited. An electric grill like this one is ideal for those situations.

Running on electricity also means that the unit does not have problems starting up, heating up and staying hot even in cold weather, so you can grill all year round.

The domed lid will let you slow cook larger pieces of meat, or even an entire chicken. This is a key part of the design because lid allows for the heat to radiate and be kept inside, perfectly cooking the food.

Another good feature is the included thermometer. With it, you can get the unit exactly as hot as you need it to be before you put the food in.

All those years of experience mean that they know grills and they sure put out some great ones like this particular infrared gas grill, which is also portable.

This is a model meant for the adventurous grillers. It has a sturdy, rugged built, which makes it a great one for camping, the beach, or to take on any kind of excursion.

The firebox and the lid are made from cast aluminum and the grilling grate and lid latches are made of stainless steel, and it has heat-resistant carrying handles on both sides.

It has a simple and lightweight table top design, so you can you just relax or do other things while your food is grilling. The top handle is designed to let you open the hinged lid easily.

The unit also incorporates the Char-Broil TRU-Infrared cooking system, which uses radiant heat instead of convective heat to cook your food, which cooks food faster and without drying it. You can cook a steak in 5 minutes and it will come out with all its juices and flavors.

It can also be converted for use with a 20 lb. gas tank, in case you want to use it in an environment, where you won’t necessarily be moving it around a lot.

The only problem with the unit is that it can get really hot at times and is tricky to control then.

It is indeed well-built in a straightforward design. It has a commercial grade stainless steel construction that is all welded, so it’s very robust and there are no little hinge pieces that could come off.

It features V-shaped stainless steel grids, with a ceramic burner and infrared technology. This combination reduces flare-ups and keeps food flavor when it’s cooked.

The unit provides lots of evenly-distributed heat, all the while remaining compact.

This certainly is an excellent unit, and one of the best you can buy if you’re going for portability. The burner design is the same as the one used in restaurants so, you’ll have professional quality, juicy food anywhere.

In addition, the manufacturer offers a great range of accessories for use with their grills, such as portable stands, natural gas conversion kits and a variety of mounting plates and grids.

It is certainly a well-designed quality product.

This one is an elegant, very sturdily built grill that provides a large main cooking surface and features two stainless steel tube burners and porcelain-coated cast iron grates, which makes them resistant to rust and very easy to clean. It also includes a swing-away rack where you can keep food warm or use as a secondary cooking area.

It has two metallic side shelves giving you plenty of space for preparing your food or for keeping your cooking utensils. These shelves can be folded down, so that it’s easier to move your grill around, and convenient for when you need to store it.

Being made by Char-Broil, it incorporates their TRU-Infrared cooking system, which allows for better temperature control and distributes heat evenly across the cooking surface, so that food cooks faster and uses less gas.

You can also convert it from propane to natural gas with a conversion kit, which is sold separately.

<h2>Reviews of the Best George Foreman Grills for 2018</h2>
<h3>1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004W499?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">George Foreman GGR50B Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill</a></h3>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004W499?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2759 alignright"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GGR50B-Indoor-Outdoor-Electric-Grill.jpg"" alt=""GGR50B Indoor, Outdoor Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>The unit blends convenience with function. Set up is fairly easy, and the build is very sturdy.

It is also a George Foreman grill with removable plates, a grease tray, a domed lid with an adjustable vent, a power cord which includes the temperature control and a stand.

The stand is made out of plastic and aluminum and the stabilizing legs all clip together, so you won’t need any tools when putting it together. Since the stand is removable, you’ll be able to take it from the backyard to the countertop in no time.

The grill plate has a non-stick coating, called the George Tough Coating. It’s durable, easy to clean and lets you cook without using butter or oil.

With five individual heat settings of the model, you can cook using slow heat all the way up to being able to using searing temperatures.

The temperature control will surely be a familiar experience if you’ve used gas grills in the past and a new experience that you’re likely to welcome if you’ve only used charcoal grills. Whatever you want to cook, you’ll be able to easily adjust the temperature for it.

Thanks to the electronic controls, heat is perfectly maintained and the unit has the ability to self-regulate by turning the heating element on or off. You don’t even have to think about it, just set the temperature and let it do what it has to do.

You’ll also get the versatility of outdoor and indoor grilling. You can use it outside with the included stand or put on your counter, a picnic table or another heat-resistant surface. It won’t be a problem, since it has feet at the bottom. Of course, you can also use it inside with the stand.

The construction itself is also built with two materials, just like the stand. The quality of the materials is appropriate for the price range, but that is not to say that they are of bad or cheap quality.

Aluminum is used for the cooking surface and the lid. The cooking surface is coated in high quality Teflon, which is scratch resistant when used with wooden or plastic utensils.

All in all, the build is rather good, making it a top rated George Foreman grill.

<h3>2. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQIUUWU?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">George Foreman GFO201R Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill</a></h3>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQIUUWU?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2757 alignright"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GFO201R-Indoor-Outdoor-Electric-Grill.jpg"" alt=""GFO201R Indoor, Outdoor Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one is very easy to set up, so if you’re buying online, that should not be one of your concerns. The whole thing takes about thirty minutes to put together and all the tools you will need is a Phillips head screwdriver.

The first thing you’ll notice when getting the unit out of the box is its high quality and unique design. This particular model is meant for both indoor and outdoor use, so you’ll have the freedom and versatility to cook how you want to cook.

There is another feature of the design: the cooking surface is sloped, which allows for the fat to drip into a collection tray while you’re cooking the food. This means that your food will have close to half the amount of fat it would have if it had been cooked on an ordinary cooking surface.

You’ll also be able to achieve searing temperatures with this grill, so your food will not be left without moisture.

This one surely looks and feels like a high quality appliance. We won’t say that it’s not, but in the price range this grill is found, compromises are inevitable. Although for the price, you will not be disappointed.

The one negative thing that can be said about its construction is that the stand, being made of plastic, is not as heavy as it could be. There is the possibility of it not being able to withstand very strong winds. But it’s still stable in most conditions.

The cooking surface is perfectly coated in Teflon. It’s very well put together, so you don’t have to worry about this grill falling apart even after years of use.

<h3>3. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CVTT2U?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">George Foreman GRP4EMB Multi-Plate Evolve Grill</a></h3>

It’s affordable, versatile and easy to use.

The model has an attractive design with high quality metals and plastics. The cooking plates are solid but not too heavy that are attached easily, so that you won’t have to waste any time setting it up.

Aside from the high quality construction, an obvious benefit of the unit is that you’ll be able to use it not just for grilling. With the interchangeable plates, you’ll be able to cook different kinds of foods.

The standard grill plate is just as good as you would expect and it’s slanted so that the fat drips onto the dripping tray. The result of this design creates food cooked with far less fat.

It’s perfect if you’re on a low fat diet. You can cook a steak perfectly with little fat and while retaining all of its moisture.

With the deep dish tray, you can cook bread, pizza, vegetables or just about anything you want to put in there. The cupcake and muffin tray looks just like a regular tray of its kind, but it’s been designed to fit the grill.

The grilling process is simple. There isn’t a lot of mess thanks to the dripping tray and it’s very easy to clean up.

The removable cooking plates can be put in the dishwasher, which is something you probably won’t have to do every time, since you can just use paper towels to clean this up.

The unit reaches full temperature in about five minutes and it will maintain whatever temperature you select. There is also a timer included, so you can ensure perfect cooking times.

But the deep dish tray is probably the star of the show for the Evolve. This is the most versatile accessory and you can do practically anything on it from scrambled eggs to toasted sandwiches.

You do have to be careful with the amount you pour into the deep dish tray. If you put too much in there, it might overflow and create a bit of a mess.

The cooking trays and release handles feel sturdy, which is important because the whole idea is that you’ll be switching those out very often. In case of any problems, the tray accessories can be purchased separately and you can get additional ones.

Although a little smaller than the previous one, this one also offers lots of versatility.

You get five removable grill plates: two grill plates, two waffle plates and a griddle or deep dish tray. You’ll have no need to buy any other accessories, they already come with the unit.

So you’ll be able to have waffles for breakfast, Paninis for lunch and steak for dinner by cooking them all on the same appliance.

The unit can be easily cleaned without even using the dishwasher, thanks to its detachable plates. Just be a little careful to ensure that you don’t end up damaging the nonstick surface while cleaning the countertop grill.

Another good thing about the model is that it has a temperature control knob which you no longer need to unplug the appliance to turn it off. Although it’s only marked “1”, “2” and “3”, which is equivalent to low, medium and high, it’s better than nothing.

This grill is definitely worth it if you’re looking for something easy to use that offers the versatility of interchangeable plates and temperature control.

However, its small size does not necessarily make it less powerful. In fact, the build quality and the material of the plates are of the superior variety.

The plates on the equipment are also removable, although this is only for the convenience of cleaning them in the dishwasher. It does not come with plates other than the ones for regular grilling.

The plates are non-stick, so you won’t need butter or oil when cooking and they are durable enough to resist constant use or constant cleaning.

Another great feature of this model is that it heats up fast allowing you to expect your food to be ready in about ten minutes.

Go for this one if you are a beginner in the field and want to cook up small meals initially.

<h2>What Should Be Your Pick?</h2>
What is the Best George Foreman Grill for 2018? With so many options, it’s really hard to tell. If you’re looking for one that you can as a backyard grill as well as on the tabletop, then we say go with the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004W499?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>GGR50B Indoor/Outdoor Grill</strong></a>.

It offers great value for the money and the only real disadvantage is that part of its construction is plastic. You can even choose it if you want to replace a charcoal or a gas one.

But if you’re looking for something that is a little bit more than a grill, then we say choose the Multi-Plate Evolve model. It’s one of the most versatile models which is also easy to use and you will not be limiting yourself to just grilling. You’ll be able to cook different types of food, although in relatively small amounts.
<h2>Why Should You Invest on a George Foreman Grill?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3024"" title=""best george foreman grill"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/22.-best-george-foreman-grill-579x1024.png"" alt=""best george foreman grill"" width=""300"" height=""531"" />
There are benefits to having and using an electric grill like the George Foreman type grills. In some cases, it can even replace a conventional gas or charcoal grill.
<h3>Availability of Fuel Does Not Affect the Operation</h3>
One of the biggest benefits is that, as long as there is electricity, you never have to worry about fuel and you’ll never have difficulty lighting up your grill. The weather will not be a problem for you either.
<h3>Comes with Fat Reducing Feature</h3>
A striking aspect of the George Foreman grills is their ability to drain out the fat from the food item, which is the main reason why they are popularly referred to as the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.
<h3>A Lot More Energy Efficient</h3>
Electric grills are also energy-efficient as you only need to have it on for the amount of time that you’ll be using it. There’s no waiting a long time for the equipment to reach the desired temperature and there are no long cool down periods afterwards.
<h3>Easy to Clean</h3>
Ease of cleaning is another benefit. The George Foreman grills are designed to be easy to clean, and include non-stick coating to allow you to clean the grates with a towel even before they have completely cooled down.

In some models, the grilling plates can be thrown in the dishwasher too.","5 Best Rated George Foreman Grills In %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"

A charcoal smoker is usually designed to cook food under direct heat hence an offset smoker might not give you the same result as you desire if you are thinking of cheating the rule.
<h2>2. Get your fire and heat ready</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2798 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Get-your-fire-and-heat-ready.jpg"" alt=""Get your fire and heat ready"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Open the smoker’s lid and remove the grill grates. Then, pour some coals in the fire area and light it up.

Leave the fire open to air to allow it have a good light on all the coals.

Once you have got a good light on your coals, manage the heat.

The specialty of using a charcoal smoker is the technique of managing the coals while cooking. Then, all the other aspects fall into place more easily.

Follow the next three steps to guide you in choosing the best form of coal arrangement to give you the best result on your food.
<h2>3. One - sided filling</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2789 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/One-sided-filling.jpg"" alt=""One - sided filling"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Get a complete balance of hot and cold with this one. Arrange coals on one side of the fire area and the leave the other side empty.

The purpose for this is to allow you move food from the heated side to a completely cold area to control the heat level cooking the food.

A trick to this is that you can place an aluminum bowl with water on the empty side of the fire area. This will aid in adding some cool to the heated food when placed over the bowl.
<h2>4. Double sided filling</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2797 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Double-sided-filling.jpg"" alt=""Double sided filling"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

This technique unlike the former requires you to spread the lighted coal onto both left and right sides of the fire area while leaving the middle part clear of any coals.

It is a technique that should be used for cooking big portions of food as this creates more heat than the previous method.

A trick to this is to have one side loaded with more hot coals than the other to aid with heat control as you move the food from one side to the other.
<h2>5. All across filling</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2794 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/All-across-filling.jpg"" alt=""All across filling"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

The third technique allows for an equal filling of coals across the fire box.

However, in order to control heat, the coals used will have to be less dense and spread openly across the fire area so as to create a fair balance of heat for smoking.
<h2>6. Add some flavoring</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2793 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Add-some-flavoring.jpg"" alt=""Add some flavoring"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Soak some flavored wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes and then add them to the lighted coals. The goal of the wet wood chips is to give off the sweet smoky flavor to the food which is essential for the char-grill effect that we mentioned earlier.
<h2>7. Start cooking</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2791 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Start-cooking.jpg"" alt=""Start cooking"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

This is a good time to bring the coal set up style to food effect.

Open the lid and alternate the food over the arranged coals to manage the amount of heat that goes into the food as you desire.
<h2>10. Manage temperatures</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2788 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Manage-temperatures.jpg"" alt=""Manage temperatures"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Make good use of the dampers at the top and sides of the smoker to control airflow into the smoker.

Also, it is important to check temperatures with the thermometer attached to the machine or any other that is convenient to use to ensure that you have the exact temperature required to cook the food.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Make fire separately</h3>
An alternate way for making fire is to light up the coals in a separate chimney with coals and once they light up, transfer them to the smoker’s fire box.

This may be a more convenient method for some users.
<h3>Oil your grates</h3>
To avoid the grill grates from sticking food onto it, always grease it by brushing some vegetable oil on the grates.

A little oil should go a long way.
<h3>Have lighted coals on standby</h3>
Always ensure to have some more lighted coals in readiness to add to the fire if the heat is reducing and requires some more fire.

This will help maintain a uniform level of heat in the smoker.
<h3>Stay safe</h3>
Always wear heat proof gloves when cooking as the smoker will get very hot after a while.
Don’t risk yourself by using just a napkin when touching the smoker. This is too light a material to take chances with.
<h3>Take it one step at a time</h3>
For entry level users, it is advisable to start with a small amount of rib pieces while learning to smoke. (And if you're newbie, I suggest you read <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-smoker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this guideline about how to use a general smoker</a>

<h2>2. Prepare your food</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2806 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Prepare-your-food.jpg"" alt=""Prepare your food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

As propane lights up easily, the best thing to do before heating up your smoker is to prepare your food and wood chips.

Season your meat with a dry rub or spice of your choice, wrap it in cling film and marinate it in a refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
<h2>3. Get wood flavoring ready</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2802 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Get-wood-flavoring-ready.jpg"" alt=""Get wood flavoring ready"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

<h2>4. Prep up the smoker</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2805 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Prep-up-the-smoker.jpg"" alt=""Prep up the smoker"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

About this time, your food and wood are ready to get into operation.

Secure the knobs on the propane cylinder and the connection to the smoker. This will prevent you from leaking propane while cooking.

As also known, a leakage can easily cause a fire. Beware to keep safe.
<h2>5. Create more flavoring</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2799 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Create-more-flavoring.jpg"" alt=""Create more flavoring"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

<h2>8. Get the smoker heated up</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2801 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Get-the-smoker-heated-up.jpg"" alt=""Get the smoker heated up"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

The smoker should be ready now to introduce fire. Propane smokers have an ignition that allows you turn on, increase, decrease and turn off fire in the smoker easily.

Hence to start the fire, release the gas knob on the cylinder to let out propane and light the burner (s) by applying the ignition as the manufacturer's manual guides you.

Your fire should be lit and ready to heat up the smoker.
<h2>9. Cook your food</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2814 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cook-your-food.jpg"" alt=""Cook your food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Close the door of the smoker and do not open it to look at the food while it is smoking. You can only do this between 1 ½ hours to 2 hours after closing the door.

Once you open the door prematurely, heat will be let out of the smoker and will affect the cooking process.

Try to avoid the urge to keep looking at the food while it is cooking. It will save you stress in the long run.
<h2>11. Check temperatures and fuel.</h2>

After about 2 hours, you can now open the smoker’s door to reduce the heat with the regulator.

Add more wood chips to the fuel compartment which is also a good time to add water to the moisture-providing bowl.

After this process, close the door of the smoker and continue cooking.
<h2>12. Check food’s doneness</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2811 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Check-food’s-doneness.jpg"" alt=""Check food’s doneness"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

So, if you already have such another type of smoker as electric smoker, offset smoker, I think you'll want to read <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-smoker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this article</a>, it helps you in using a general smoker and finding helpful resources about other types of smokers
<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Use the right wood</h3>
Any wood isn’t wood when it comes to smoking. There are special woods in the market meant for this purpose that come flavored and unflavored as per your choice.

Do not be careless to use treated lumber or plywood instead. These contain chemicals that can harm the body when transferred to the food.
<h3>Preheat before use</h3>
Always ensure to preheat the smoker for about 10 to 15 minutes before you place the food in the smoker to cook.

Preheating disinfects the device and creates a welcoming environment for the food to begin cooking in a good state.
<h3>Stay safe</h3>
Once your food is done, immediately turn off the burners and close the gas release knob on the propane cylinder before you proceed to do anything else.

As said earlier, gas can be a dangerous chemical and if mishandled, it can lead to havoc.
<h3>Clean when cool</h3>
Only clean the smoker when it has cooled down.

Considering safety again, it is better to not clean while the device is still hot so as to not burn yourself.

2781,"How To Use An Offset Smoker In 8 Simple Steps With Pictures","Offset smokers are special in their own kind of way. They are built to have more focus on adding extra flavors while cooking.
This means, if you get the heat in the smoker right, your food will have the right temperatures and level of good smoke cooking it.
Cooking food with this equipment follows the same procedure as many other smokers do, hence this should be easy for even an entry-level user to use.
Not further we do, let’s dive into the breakdown of how to use an offset smoker to achieve the best of flavors.
<h2>1. <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-offset-smoker-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">First, get an offset smoker</a> that works best for you</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2831 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/First-get-an-offset-smoker-that-works-best-for-you.jpg"" alt=""First, get an offset smoker that works best for you"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

They usually are a long chamber grill, with a smoker box on one end and a chimney on another end. Fire is created in the smoker box, heats through the chamber that the food is placed on and then smokes out through the chimney.

Therefore, the food doesn’t cook on a direct fire, it is rather done by heat and smoke generated from the fire box.

This gives you more assurance of your food less likely to burn.
<h2>2. Prepare your fuel</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2825 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Prepare-your-fuel.jpg"" alt=""Prepare your fuel"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Most offset smokers use charcoal and wood for fuel which makes using the offset smoker a cheaper option.

Get the best type of charcoal that will give you the best heating result and choose the flavoring of wood that you prefer for flavoring.

Ensure to use dry wood when using an offset smoker as it will help create good smoke for the food.

After this, start your smoker fuel or fire in separate hollow container until the coals are all lighted up.
<h2>3. Load your fire</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2820 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Load-your-fire.jpg"" alt=""Load your fire"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

The best ways to getting the best heat for your smoker are as follows:

Fill a half part of the fire box with your choice of charcoal.

Then, transfer the lighted coal to the empty half of the fire box and close the lid for about 10 minutes. This will help the coals light faster.

After, open the lid and add the dry wood. Leave it to light up partially and then close the lid.
<h2>4. Control flavoring with the chimney</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2830 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Control-flavoring-with-the-chimney.jpg"" alt=""Control flavoring with the chimney"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

After making the fire, the chimney is an important aspect for ensuring that you do not have bad smoke cooking your food.

Always keep the chimney open when cooking to allow every bad smoke escape from the smoker.

Most importantly, the chimney in this case does not serve as an airflow regulator.
<h2>5. Use the dampers to control fire</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2828 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Use-the-dampers-to-control-fire.jpg"" alt=""Use the dampers to control fire"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

The dampers are simply made to help control the level of air that goes into the fire box which has an effect on the heat created.

Locate the dampers usually on the side of the smoker and open it in various levels for the best results.

A full opening will let in a lot of oxygen into the smoker which will lighten the coals faster.

A partial opening will allow in a smaller amount of air for fairly heated coals.

A total closure will mean no air going into the smoker which is necessary to drastically reduce the heat in the smoker.
<h2>6. You ain’t cooking when looking</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2829 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/You-ain’t-cooking-when-looking.jpg"" alt=""You ain’t cooking when looking"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Just like in many other smokers, marinate your food as you desire and once the smoker is 210 °F to 275 °F, place your food on the grill grate and most importantly, close the lid of the smoker.

The lid of your smoker should be constantly closed during cooking. You can only open the fire box to add fuel to the fire which is discussed in the next point.

Aside from this, let the food cook closed for at least 1 to 1 ½ hours before you open the lid to check for doneness. Otherwise, the cooking temperatures will be interrupted and will affect the food.
<h2>7. Manage heat</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2822 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Manage-heat.jpg"" alt=""Manage heat"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

While your food cooks, keep the temperature in the good heating state. This should be between 210 °F to 275 °F.

If the fire has burned out after a while, open the fire box and add more wood (not charcoal), then keep the lid open for about 10 minutes for the wood to catch enough fire and then close the lid.
<h2>8. Manage temperatures with the vents or dampers</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2824 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Manage-temperatures-with-the-vents-or-dampers.jpg"" alt=""Manage temperatures with the vents or dampers"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Close the vent halfway to reduce the flow of oxygen into the fire so that the smoker is not too heated up.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Avoid bad smoke</h3>
Good smoke for cooking is usually light and blue and should be maintained always. Once you experience thick smoke coming from your chimney, it is time to do an immediate check.
This simply means that the fire is lacking oxygen to make it burn well.
So, solve the problem by opening the firebox and use a metal rod to stir the fire well. It will allow oxygen in, your coals will light up and you should be good to continue cooking.
<h3>Stay safe</h3>
Always wear heat proof gloves when cooking as you will be dealing with heat all along while using the smoker.

This will prevent you from getting burnt.
<h3>Clean after always</h3>
Once you are done cooking, always ensure to clean your smoker while it is warm. This aids with an easy and more effective clean.

2784,"How To Use An Electric Smoker In 7 Easy Steps With Pictures","We all may have been accustomed to the old forms of grilling, that is, using a charcoal or wood grill - our grandparents taught us or we learned it some other way! These are good but we can all attest to their lengthy operational approach.

For this reason, the electric smoker came into being. It is one of the fastest smokers with excellent technology for simplifying the process of grilling which is 50% better in operation than the traditional smoker.

This article, therefore, breaks down the process of how to use an electric smoker in the simplest form possible.
<h2><a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-electric-smoker-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">1. Find an electric smoker that works for you</a></h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2819 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Find-an-electric-smoker-that-works-for-you.jpg"" alt=""Find an electric smoker that works for you"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Consider your needs and find one that fits them perfectly. Needs could be the food size you are hoping to make, availability of electricity, good plug connection to an electrical source etc.

Now, when you have got one, ensure to position it in an area that is electricity safe. With this, you should be good to start using. If you're newbie in BBQ smoking field, I think you should read my guideline about <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-smoker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">how to use a general smoker</a>
<h2>2. Power up your baby</h2>

It is an electric smoker and like every other smoker needs the power to get it running.

Connect the smoker to an electricity source with its plug and turn the ignition on. Use the manufacturer’s guide to aid you.
<h2>3. Flavoring and moisturizing your food</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2821 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flavoring-and-moisturizing-your-food.jpg"" alt=""Flavoring and moisturizing your food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Ensure that there is an aluminum plate directly under the grill grates, which you should fill with water and choice herbs for adding flavor and moisture to the food before you start grilling.

If the smoker doesn’t come with one, you can use any aluminum tray at all for this. Just ensure that it is deep enough to hold water.
<h2>4. Add that magical smoke flavoring</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2816 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Add-that-magical-smoke-flavoring.jpg"" alt=""Add that magical smoke flavoring"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

In the past, there were complaints of electric smokers not having the ability to give up smoky flavors as the charcoal grill will - this has now been modified!

Newer trends now have the feature for smoky flavors now available.

Find the wood chip loader on your smoker (use the manufacturer’s guide to aid), load wood chips into it with the flavor of your choice, close the loader and be ready to start flavoring up.
<h2>5. Benefit from the extra wood chip / residue pan</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2817 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefit-from-the-extra-wood-chip-residue-pan.jpg"" alt=""Benefit from the extra wood chip, residue pan"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Some electric smokers will have a small unit under the grill grates for storing wood chips.

This pan also serves as a residue holder from the wood loader that helps enhance the flavoring that gets to the meat.

Hence, do not be too quick to discard the residue, let it flavor up your food some more and you will be glad you did not.
<h2>6. Time for the food</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2815 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Time-for-the-food.jpg"" alt=""Time for the food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Your electric smoker should have enough grill grates to serve your numbers well. Once fueling has been put in place, place your marinated food on the grated, close the grill and secure the lock.

You will not be opening the grill until the timer is done, therefore make sure you have the food positioned in well.
<h2>7. Start cooking</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2812 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Start-cooking-1.jpg"" alt=""Start cooking"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Find the temperature and timer gauge on your device.

Most temperatures range from 100 °F to 275 °F, set the temperature and timer of your choice and start grilling.
<h2>8. Manage temperatures</h2>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-2826 aligncenter"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Manage-temperatures-1.jpg"" alt=""Manage temperatures"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Use the vents to adjust temperatures while cooking. It is not the best to alter the temperatures on the gauge, this will affect the food’s doneness.

Control airflow in the grill with the vents.

A closed vent will mean no air going through the smoker, a partially open vent will mean a fair amount of air circulating in the smoker, and a completely open vent will imply a lot of air having a free way within.

If the plugs do not fit into your plug connection at home, you can have the plugs changed to suit you or use a multifunctional socket to aid with this.

Multifunctional sockets must be able to handle the smoker’s voltage before being used else you will cause a blow-up.
<h3>Don’t poison yourself</h3>
Do not use your grill indoors due to carbon monoxide poisoning. While using your smoker, you may not burn fuel very well, however, airflow outdoors creates enough ventilation to blow any form of poisoning away.

Hence, if you use your smoker indoors, we need not say further.
<h3>No looking while cooking</h3>
Just like other smokers, the same thing applies here. Opening the smoker while cooking will interrupt the temperatures which will produce badly done food. The smoker has a gauge, set it and rely on it to do a great job.
<h3>Don’t stain the world</h3>
The smoker could create greasy materials while it cooks or from frequent usage. Wear gloves when using it.

This will help you avoid staining yourself and other items around.
<h3>Clean more efficiently</h3>
Cover the grease trapping tray at the bottom of the smoker with aluminum foil. Once you are done with cooking, all you need will be to remove the foil with a few wipes afterward, and you are one big step away from a painful clean.

The legs are made of aluminum and although they feel a little weak, it’s necessary to take the purpose this grill was made for into account. Sturdier legs would make it heavier and therefore less portable. Although the legs are not the most solid part of the grill, they perform the job just well.

The cooking grate is metallic and triple plated with a nickel alloy. This makes it resistant to corrosion and prevents the food from sticking to it.

It also helps with the dispersion of heat along the cooking surface. Overall, it is a nice little grill made with quality and portability in mind as far as weber tailgating grills go.

Set up is fairly easy, and the build is very sturdy.

The grill includes a removable grilling plate, a grease tray, a domed lid with an adjustable vent, a power cord which includes the temperature control and a stand.

The stand is made out of plastic and aluminum and the stabilizing legs all clip together, so you won’t need any tools when putting it together. Since the stand is removable, you’ll be able to take this grill from outside to the countertop in no time.

The George Foreman tailgating grill plate has a non-stick coating to make it durable, easy to clean and lets you cook without using butter or oil.

With the five individual heat settings, you can cook using slow heat or you can set it to searing temperatures.

Thanks to the electronic controls, heat is perfectly maintained and the grill has the ability to self-regulate by turning the heating element on or off. There is no need for you to intervene, just set the temperature and let it do what it is intended to do.

You’ll also get the versatility of outdoor and indoor grilling. You can use it outside with the included stand or put it on your counter, a picnic table or another heat-resistant surface. It won’t be a problem, since the body of grill itself has feet at the bottom. It’s lightweight enough for you to take tailgating or on any excursions.

The grill is constructed with two materials, just like the stand. The quality of the materials seems appropriate for the price range, but that is not to say that they are of bad or cheap quality.

<h2>Things to Consider While Choosing a Tailgate Grill</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-2976"" title=""Best Tailgate Grills"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/25.-best-tailgate-grill-Done-538x1024.png"" alt=""Best Tailgate Grills"" width=""300"" height=""571"" />
Looking for a great portable gas grill for tailgating? Wondering what the best tailgate grill is? Well, these are some of the factors to take into consideration.
<h3>Frequency of Use</h3>
Consider how frequent your use of the grill will be. Generally, tailgate gas grills and tailgate charcoal grills undergo more wear and tear because of outdoor usage and therefore, it is good to go for high-quality products for frequent use.
<h3>Durability</h3>
Most tailgate grills are well-built so, in all probability, you are hardly required to compromise on the durability aspect while choosing the best grill for tailgating.
<h3>Temperature Control Facility</h3>
A temperature control facility is a must have in the unit you choose. Not having one can create serious problems during tailgating.
<h3>Number of Burners</h3>
Whether you choose a single burner unit or one with two burners, will depend on how many people you will usually be cooking for and how fast you want it to be done.
<h3>Power Source of the Grill</h3>
This is yet another consideration. Whether you want a gas grill, charcoal grill or electric grill will again depend on your comfort zone as both have their share of pros and cons.","5 Best Tailgate Grills: For A Happy Camping Time (%%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%)"

It is a 40-inch sized smoker with 4 interior chromed smoking racks that has the ability to cook up to 100 pounds of meat. This makes it very handy for camping and tailgating parties.

This smoke hollow propane smoker contains 4 stainless steel burners which guarantees enough fire for quick cooking, a push button ignition, gas control valve powered by a Type 1 regulator and a hose. Two things are therefore checked off your list here; safety and an extra saving on parts.

Thinking of the smoky flavors in your food that you wish to have? This type of smoker serves that purpose. It comes with an built in porcelain coated wood chip tray that allows you to fill in your choice of wood to exude amazing aromas into your food while it cooks.

You will not need to stress over finding the right steel water pan to aide you in creating moisture for your food while it cooks. This smoker solves this problem with its built in water tray.

Checking temperatures are also sorted out with its built in temperature gauge. While temperatures are a key part of smoking, you can be guaranteed an accurate read of heat while your food cooks instead of relying on thermometers that may mislead you.

Finally, we love this smoker for its black powder coated outer shell which is a standard classy finish to blend in the design.

It is well constructed and will prove to remain in the same quality after a long while.

It comes with a push button electronic ignition for quick to start and easy lighting. Lighting a burner with a matchstick is old news and we are glad that this smoker comes with this modern technology. However, the disadvantage to this may be the inability to start up your device if there is no electricity available.

This is a smoker ideal for big numbers offering close to 800 square inches of space for cooking. If you are considering running a mini restaurant and are bent on saving some money in the process, this device will be a great option for you to choose from. Consider its cost, cooking space and durability.

It’s dual door design create a good temperature control and uninterrupted cooking when there is the need to fuel with more wood. It comes with a built in wood chip tray as well as a large capacity water tray of great quality.

This Dyna-Glo device has proven to be long lasting, built with porcelain enamel coating to prevent heat damages from many hours of cooking.

Presenting the best for last, its temperature gauge is easily readable and includes a smoke flavor determination that helps detects the level of smoke flavoring that is ideal for the food being cooked. This feature is in short, amazing!

It’s vent design can be adjusted to make this device a table top. Isn’t this cool? If you lack space for an extra table, you can easily have 2 people use this smoker at a table and dinner will not be interrupted at all.

This Cuisinart contains 4 (14 x 14) inch spacious cooking grates made to cook food for up to 8 people. The racks are also removable just in case you need to grill a larger sized portion of pork.

We love it for its petite size with side handles which makes it easy to move around without any problems of disassembling due to its solid build.

It also comes with porcelain enamel coated components which accommodate high heat temperatures without affecting its build up in anyway nor does it get too heated to handle, although we will advise the use of heat proof gloves when cooking at all times.

An extra feature to this smoker is a 40-inch propane hose with regulator saving you every cent possible, you will not need to make extra purchases of a hose and regulator.

Sizes are an essential aspect when grilling and we couldn’t agree more with the Camp Chef company on this make.

It is one of the best propane smokers on the market to use with a matchless ignition system and very easily adjustable dampers to control heat.

In addition, this machine comes with a total package for the entry level user providing enough tips, guidelines and recipes to aide you in making some great food. We will highly recommend this to college students.

On the other hand, we might be saddened by the cost of this smoker. This might not be the best option for budget saving but we believe that this smoker caters to you with the great build that this cooking vault is made of.

This smoker includes 2 cooking grids and 1 jerky rack which is great for a decent number of people. It also fits a water pan for moisture creation and a wood chip tray for those smoky flavors.

Unlike many other smokers that will usually have one or two dampers, this version provides the user with 3 dampers for maximum heat control. One damper sits at the top of the device and the other two are on both sides of it.

We describe this device as a big smoker, a great recommendation for a big family. With close to 600 square inches in cooking surface area and 3 cooking grates, this smoker comes with enough space to make food for a party without the worry of running out of food.

All three grates are coated with chrome for good durability and come with a cool to touch handle that makes handling safe. This means you can open the lid while cooking without heat proof gloves, but to be on the safest side, always go with heat proof gloves.

For an amazing price, this smoker comes with a water holding pan and a wood chip tray for moisture and smoky flavor respectively.

For managing temperatures, the Char-Broil company never ceases to amaze. Being one of the cheapest to find on the market, the smoker comes with an easily adjustable upper vent for easy heat control and a top grate that can be used for warming your food.

Furthermore, you will find an added long-lasting LPG propane regulator which means you get to save more money without having to buy a propane regulator from an outside source which might not be trustworthy.

Finally, this vertical smoker comes with 2 dual door partitions, one for firing and the other for cooking which aids in keeping heat in good flow throughout the cooking period.

Although this machine may be criticised for its poor quality make, we believe that this could be a good buy if you are on a tight budget.

This steel designed smoker is one that an entry user should go for. It is designed with durability and sturdiness making it a great buy for the money. You will be rest assured using this smoker with its simple design for easy use.

Most gas smokers fall short of hangers for cooking sausages, but this version of a smoker thought it wise to include this making it a unique feature for cooking diversely. If you are a sausage freak, your needs will be met with this one.

For the money, this device may seem to be on the high side, but we believe it is still competitive due to the features it brings to the table.

It comes a push button ignition system for easy fire lighting and external temperature gauge which aids for easier temperature check rather than an interior temperature gauge.

It contains 4 cooking grates with multiple adjustment levels coupled with the sausage hangers give you plenty of room to make food.

This Smoke Hollow propane smoker also comes with upper and lower level vents which is a key feature to have in a smoker for great airflow while cooking.

It also comes with two sausage hooks allowing for more room to cook your meat dishes diversely.

In solving the problem of securing smoke and heat within, there are lock clamps added to its doors which allows you close the doors securely and safely when cooking. However, we will advise that heat proof gloves be worn when opening the door as they could get very hot.

<h3>It is the one of two fastest options that you can find</h3>
We are not sure why you would want to spend eternity trying to grill. Time is of critical essence which directly correlates to your food making.

While traditions are great, grilling as your grandfather did is okay, but is this necessary? With modern technology, you can get the same results as the old methods of grilling.

There is no doubt that propane smokers are a total blessing to the world of smoking as they come with the essentials of every smoker but also beat the best in competition with their fast approach to cooking. In approximation, you are most likely to save 1 to 2 hours of cooking time when using a gas fueled smoker.

For this reason, you can now have enough time to marinate your food for a longer period. On the other hand, if you have a work deadline or need to start prepping for dinner, a gas smoker will save you the time and headache.
<h3>Is it of a good size?</h3>
Gas meat smokers vary in sizes that can fit in almost any kind of space. Space is an essential factor when purchasing a device like this.

One thing that we like about the gas smoker is the fact that they are mostly vertical designs. They contain enough cooking area within but also have an exterior design which utilize height space rather than width space.

This could easily fit into a storage shelf if you desire to have it stored this way.

Gas smokers do not require a lot of accessories to get running, just a propane tank. If you have claims that the tank will eat up some extra space, most tanks come in cylindrical shapes that will still save you space.

Therefore, keeping your backyard spacious and beautiful to behold is guaranteed when using a vertical propane smoker.
<h3>Are they beautifully designed?</h3>
Smokers are a contributing factor to beautifying the exteriors of your home. Which is why we believe it is intentional that gas smokers are designed to fit this need.

Most propane smokers are rectangular in height, a great finish on the outside and contemporary coloring that pops out class when positioned in the backyard.

We love these smokers if you are wanting a simple look for your backyard. A small design tip, consider purchasing one of these devices with an exterior color that will match your backyard or a neutral color if you want to play safe. From a distance, you will realize the beauty it exudes onto your property.
<h3>Check for easy mobility</h3>
Mobility is key. Many of us don’t want to be burdened by holding up 3 to 4 people after a party to help reposition a smoker. They can be easily moved around which is why it is good to have a propane smoker.

On average, most of these machines weigh 40 pounds and are designed like mini wardrobes which makes handling them easier than a traditional 3-in-1 smoker grill combo.

The need of carrying your smoker from one location to another gets solved with these types of smokers. They fit very well in the back of a truck and able to be moved seamlessly to the location of choice.

However, some propane smokers may be larger in size. We will advise that you consider your needs when purchasing just so you do not feel deceived.
<h3>How simple is it to assemble?</h3>
Most propane smokers on the market come with easy to comprehend manuals to aid you in building your device once it is delivered to you.

Unlike other heavy duty smokers, these machines are like cabinets and may only need a few screws tightened here and there. Fix the cooking grates, set up the dampers and place the water and wood chips trays where necessary and you are ready to grill.

If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, kindly seek an expert to help you as to not damage your investment.
<h3>One of the easiest use to have</h3>
It almost seems as though gas smokers are designed for entry level users.

Many of the best propane smokers come with very easy to use technologies to aide the consumer. Aside from being propane gas fueled, they are also the best natural gas smokers that can be found on the market making fueling easy.

They usually come with quick start ignition systems, easy-to-use cooking grates and built in thermometers that will help you practice those recipes.
<h2>What should then be your consideration for your purchase?</h2>
<h3>Go for a great build</h3>
Before making your purchase, spend quality time researching the various products on the market and reading as many propane smoker reviews before finally making a choice.

Do not rely on brand names as some brand names may have produced good products in the past but not the device you are currently going to purchase.

Some materials of build to look out for are stainless steel, porcelain, cast iron and chrome. These elements are very resistant to rust, very good heat holders and do not wear and tear easily. Stainless steel propane smokers may be one of the more popular choices among consumers for its resistance to rust and sleek looking design.

Consider the welding strength of the device just so you do not have the smoker’s door coming of its hinges one month down the line.
<h3>It must be sturdy</h3>
Most propane smokers come with 4-legged stands to support the vertical build of the device.

Ensure to check for a stand that sits solidly on the ground. Do not compromise for a wobbly stand simply because its pricing is good. In just a matter of time, your smoker will be completely bent to the ground.

Check for warranty options in case you encounter unstable legs after a short while, so you can quickly report the problem to the manufacturer for a change or fix.
Consider this tip very seriously as many have overlooked this feature and had problems down the line.
<h3>Have enough room for temperatures</h3>
If the smoker comes with a temperature gauge, aim for one that has between 50 F to 500 F. Having enough room to adjust temperatures is the best treatment that you can give your food. If you have a smoker that falls short of this, please walk away.

However, if the smoker does not come with a thermometer of its own, you are always able to purchase a thermometer and attach it to your new smoker. .

Always ensure to consider temperatures are one of the key aspects for grilling food and cannot be done without.
<h3>What is your serving size?</h3>
We always advise to go for a bigger sized smoker even if you are aiming to feed just yourself and your best friend.

These devices are designed to last a long time like many other cooking equipment. There will be the need to cook for a few more friends pretty soon and the bigger size consideration will come in handy.

Look out for the dimensions of the machine’s build and more importantly the cooking surface area. Most manuals will give you a serving size approximation or you can simply read about it online to help you make a good choice.
<h3>Go for a front-loading design</h3>
Most smokers now come with a front door loading design which makes placing and removing food from your smoker one of the easiest things to do.

It is also a safer and cleaner option to have as compared to a top load option which will only make your work more difficult when positioning food on the racks. When you need to open the door and make some food adjustments, you will have more control to turn food around with ease. This option will also prevent you from getting burns while working.
<h3>What is the product and part availability like on the market</h3>
Always go for one that is readily available on the market and has enough parts available to purchase.

In short, if there are limited supply of the products and parts, your smoker may be as good as scrap in a matter of one year as you will be unable to make quick fixes to it in case of any major damages.
<h3>Dual door options are better</h3>
The 2-door option allows you cook food in one area and make your fire in another area without any interruptions to your food while it cooks.

It is the ideal solution for loading more wood chips to your smoker as well as adding water to your water pan for moisture.

<h2>Reviews of The Best Charcoal Smoker</h2>
<h3>1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BQMDZYY?tag=brobbq-charcoal-smoker-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Pit Barrel 18” Cooker Package</a></h3>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BQMDZYY?tag=brobbq-charcoal-smoker-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img class=""size-full wp-image-2914 alignright"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/18-in-Classic-Pit-Barrel-Cooker-Package.jpg"" alt=""18 in Classic Pit Barrel Cooker Package"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This smoker has a simpler approach making it seamlessly easy to use. Instead of having only grill grates like many other smokers, it is comes with hooks that allows you hang your meat when smoking. The idea of camping and cooking at night will resonate with you.

For its simple design, it could be argued to be an expensive option, but its strong build with hooks and standard grates cover its cost making it a versatile device. If you have a big budget and want something different, this will be a pampering buy for you.

It has good heat distribution due to its cylindrical design that holds high temperatures giving you a very even cook on your food.

One amazing thing about this smoker is its method of exuding flavors. When cooking meat hung over the charcoal fire, the juices of the meat drip onto the fire which then return to the meat as smoky flavoring making the aromas from your backyard unresistable.

Finally, this device is a “set it and forget it device”. Once the fueling and damper settings are set correctly, with the help of the operating guide (for beginners), the device is able to keep temperatures at the standard you wish to cook with for over 3 hours without any interruptions in temperatures.

You practically can keep this on your balcony and smoke from there.

The exterior of this device is made with a strong steel structure, a strong securing lid, cool to touch handles and a vertically hinged door which is durable for a good while but will need to be covered if left outside.

The smoker comes with a porcelain enameled coated water bowl, a latched base, a built-in thermometer, a water and charcoal pan, and a steel charcoal grate. This is great value for its cost.

It produces a good amount of food, however, for its weight it is not suggested to cook heavier items of food on it. Some hamburgers, sausages and 5 pound meat should keep it stable for a longer period. With this smoker you might have to start cooking in advance to have enough food to go round.
Otherwise, this unit is one of the easiest to assemble devices on the market with tips and recipes included.

It would be an ideal gift for a newly wedded couple.

<h2>Our Most Loved Option</h2>
With this amazing collection of charcoal smokers, choosing just one almost seems the hardest.

However, there is always that one that shines above every other and here we have the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BQMDZYY?tag=bro-bbq-smoker-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>Pit Barrel 18” Cooker Package</strong></a> as our best charcoal smoker in this series.

This unit meets all the prerequisites we chose for this review and tops it off with its flavoring system.

Now, remember that the charcoal smoker is distinguished by its ability to provide the best flavors, hence why we believe that the Pit Barrel Cooker tops the rest on this.

We also like it for its “set it and forget it”, making it super user friendly. We are sure you don’t want to be standing by a smoker all day to make a decent meal.

Finally, it is a space saver and can sit well on a balcony.
<h2>Do you need some more convincing to get one?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3062"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/26.-best-charcoal-smokers-502x1024.jpg"" alt=""best charcoal smokers"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />
<h3>Let’s stress on flavoring some more</h3>
There are many types of equipment like this with various fueling options but nothing beats the authentic blend of fiery charcoal, flavored wood and the marinated spicing in your meat.

Most fueling smokers come with the option to add wood chip flavors to your food but nature cannot be cheated.

For this reason, the natural blend of these two types of fuel create substantial grilling flavors on your food which should be an unbeatable reason for choosing this device.
<h3>Cheap Fueling</h3>
Electricity can be expensive if you find yourself in a locality with a lashing bill to cover costs for electricity. Which is why charcoal comes in handy to help out.

Considering outdoor barbecues like a tailgating party, there might not be a convenient electricity source nearby to help you light up your device and smoke at ease. However, with charcoal, all you need to do is carry some briquettes with you and your party will boom.

Charcoal is one of the cheapest materials to find and can be found in every store nearby.

You can buy as much as you want and preserve them for future use.

Of course, other types of fuel has its own advantages and disadvantages, you can <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-smoker-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">read more here</a> to know more about other kinds of smokers using different types of fuel.
<h3>Heat Control</h3>
This is one of the most important reasons why we love charcoal fueling. The ability to hold a good amount of heat that is evenly distributed across the grill.

Charcoal may take a bit longer to light but with good airflow in your smoker, you should be up and running in no time.

Once your fire is lit, all you need to do is arrange your coals in a manner that fits your grilling needs and you will be good to retain a standard level of heat that cooks thoroughly.

Read our <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-a-charcoal-smoker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>how-to-guide</strong></a> to aid you in managing this process.
<h2>Convinced now? How then should you make your best buy?</h2>
<h3>Consider the build of the device</h3>
Fiery coals can damage your smoker if it is made with a poor quality material. Do not compromise in this field just to save a buck.

For an evenly regulated amount of heat in your smoker, this can only be achieved with a great build and strong materials.

Smokers made with cheaper materials tend to get too hot and may become a safety hazard when cooking and/or may deform the shape of the smoker over time.

Again, do not compromise on this as it is better to invest in great quality.
<h3>Consider your serving size</h3>
It is always better to add 5 additional people to your serving size to keep you safe from shortages when serving.

If you are cooking for two and you think that this is too large of a number, consider preserving the leftovers for the coming days. This will save you a lot of energy from having to restart your unit to cook over and over again.

For the party lover who must have an event at home every weekend, make a purchase that will serve big numbers. Very soon the good word from your house will reach the streets and your guests will not resist a moment to try your delicious meals.

This does not require you to be like everyone else if you are a young professional living all by yourself. Scan through our options below to find something that will serve your needs well.
<h3>Be safety conscious</h3>
When choosing a smoker, highly consider the style of fueling that it comes with.

There might be the need to fuel your unit a number of times as it cooks. You do not want to hurt yourself from the heat coming from the device in this process.

Find a fueling style that allows you load charcoal and wood in the simplest way possible and/or will allow you adjust your coals without stress.

We care about your health and we advise you to take this option seriously when making your purchase.
<h3>Be wise on spending</h3>
Spending comes with many different earning levels. From our list of recommended products, we share varying prices for the different products and we urge you to go for a quality option.

Let the thought of money be the last thing on your mind when considering making an investment like this.

Scan through all the other needs and once you are certain of what you want, weigh that against your budget and make a purchase that will serve you well.

Don’t get too cheap when making a decision. At the end of it all, the quality the smoker is what matters most.","10 Best Rated Charcoal Smokers For The Money In %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"

This highly durable smoker is built with heavy duty steel and has an excellent powder coat on the exterior making it resistant to high temperatures. A great smoker built to last!

The cooking space of this smoker has your best interests at heart. Offering a 784 square inch cooking surface area in a vertical design. The amount of food you are able to cook if manage your cooking space well is ridiculous.

The Dyna Glo offers a 15,000 BTU cast iron burner which is sure to provide substantial amounts of heat.

We the love the fact that this propane version comes with a wood tray made with heavy duty porcelain coated steel allowing you to add different types of flavors depending on the wood you choose. .

It comes with an exterior thermometer, however, there have been complaints of it not being easily readable but we think this complaint will be relative.

For the amount of food this machine makes with its strong build, we deem it to be one of the best offset smokers for the money.

The pit barrel smoker may not seem like a typical offset smoker but for the fact that it heats the food away from the cooking area will qualify it as an offset smoker.

This unique design is a refinement of the ugly drum smoker (UDS) with better quality than the UDS offers.

It is a spacious vertical smoker with a hang ‘n’ cook approach. Using the 8 stainless steel hooks allow you to hang your food while cooking instead of using the common grate approach. This then gives you more space to cook with.

For a vertical barrel, this product is brilliantly constructed of 18-gauge stainless steel and porcelain enamel which has proven to be super durable by many users.

This smoker goes a step further allowing fat juices to drip off onto the lighted fire as it cooks, enhancing the smoky flavors that cook the food.

While it may be pricey and the company is still very young, this is the best offset smoker under $1000.

Plus, the Pit Barrel Cooker has one of the easiest assembling methods that your teenager could put it together for you.

Beautifully constructed with a powder coated steel drum build and cast iron grate to ensure long-lasting use.

Aside from its durable build and lightweight structure, it is designed to make cleaning a beautiful task to look forward to. Both charcoal and ashtrays are easily removable with the double base for longer durability.

This smoker is not one for heavy-duty cooking, it is not designed for that. Rather, this model is perfect if you are on a tight budget and need to make moderately sized foods.

<h3>Consider its purpose</h3>
In our previous reviews, we have talked about the importance of adding smoky flavors to your food. This smoker is specifically built and designed for that purpose.

An offset smoker consists of two separate chambers connected together. One chamber is called the firebox which is where the coals or firewood is burned and a second chamber which holds the food.

The smoke creates in the firebox and then passes through to the other chamber and then through the flew. The smoke is cooled down while it transfers over to the meat chamber creating an offset smoker. Such an amazing technique!
<h3>Designed for more food</h3>
Typically these smokers are designed to be on a much larger scale of size. These smokers are very common in BBQ competitions and restaurants due to the amount of food they are able to produce.

Don’t let that scare you out of buying one though because offset smokers are for anyone. Just because you have the room to cook all that food, doesn’t mean that you have to, it's just nice to have the option.
On average, these smokers have the capability to produce a minimum of 20 burgers in one turn this so there is plenty of food to go around.
<h3>Do you need an all in one kind of a cooker?</h3>
An offset smoker is also equipped with multiple cooking methods; grilling, smoking, searing and roasting are all viable cooking options making this type of smoker an all-in-one offset grill.

This smoker is bound to replace several different appliances such as the oven, grill, stovetop, and smoker. So the question is why wouldn’t you need one?
<h3>Are you particular about durability?</h3>
Offset smokers are made from quality metals welded together to stand sturdy to the ground.

Considering the fact that these devices are for external use only they are designed to withstand the test of climate changes for a longer life. This smoker is sure to withstand the test of time.

Most of the offset smokers are built to be mobile as well. Some so big they are usually attached to a trailer to allow easy transfer of the smoker from site to site. While others have well built in casters available.
<h2>Important qualities you should look out for when purchasing</h2>
<h3>Is it long lasting?</h3>
These smokers are more often than not built out of galvanized steel or double thick iron making them incredibly durable and long lasting.

There are cheaper models on the market made from thinner steel that is not weatherproof as well.

So make sure and research the brand you want to purchase and check to be sure that the materials used are of high quality. You will want to shoot for a minimum lifespan of 4 years to keep you in a safe zone.
<h3>Consider your serving size</h3>
If the particular smoker does not provide more than 250 square inches of cooking surface area then ditch it for something else.

It will be totally wrong to not have enough food to go around. That would defeat the whole purpose of purchasing an offset smoker.
<h3>Consider its price</h3>
First of all, these smokers are not small smokers, meaning they do not come cheap. However, this does not mean that the deal is a rip-off, it only means best possible value offset smoker.

Investing in a quality smoker means you will have to pay more but the smoker will definitely live its name up to the price tag.

They have the option of direct heat and indirect heat to smoke foods creating a whole other form of smoking which is called “cold smoking”. This method is great to use on fish and cured meats.

They also have the ability to bake pastas, pizzas, and casseroles. Or just about anything you put in an oven, you can do the same in one of these smokers. As long as it is not a vertical smoker with an offset firebox, then you also have an option to grill foods.

3013,"8 Best Indoor Electric Grills: Top Rated Reviews In 2018","While outdoor grilling is a great pastime, not everyone has enough space available for an outdoor charcoal or gas grill. And when winter comes you still get cravings for the flavor of grilled food, but don’t want to put on a coat and boots and glove, just so you can go outside to grill and this is where the best indoor grills come to play.

Fortunately, there are many options available for making grilled food right in your kitchen. While it’s not quite the same thing as grilling over charcoal, you can still get food with grill marks, get a good sear, and juicy food with great flavor without going outdoors.

There are electric grills that suit every need and every budget. There’s just no excuse not to grill anymore.

The drawback of using indoor grills is that it can be a little messy because the juices and fat from the food will be splattering all over the counter top or table. For this reason, a few indoor grills include a cover, but this can have the effect of steaming the food a little as it cooks, which is fine for some foods but not so good for others.

Here are some of the best ones for 2018:

<h2>Factors to Consider in Choosing an Indoor Grill</h2>
Choosing a comprehensive indoor grill will always depend on what you want to achieve with it, how many people you’ll be cooking for and what you will be cooking. The one that better fits your needs will always be the best unit for you.

Some important aspects to consider while choosing are:
<h3>Size Matters</h3>
When it comes to the indoor grills, sizes can vary widely. You’ll have to think about how many people you’ll be usually cooking for.
If you have a large family, if you like to have people over or if you’ll be cooking mostly for two or three people will be the deciding factor.
<h3>Style of the Unit</h3>
You should also think about what type of grilling you want to achieve. If you want your food to be crispy grilled dishes, or if you prefer it to be juicy.
For instance, the crispy grilling process needs an open grill, if you want juicier food, you will need a grill that can be closed or covered. You must also consider if you want just an indoor electric grill or something that’s more of multi-purpose kitchen appliance.
<h3>Power &amp; Potential</h3>
Wattage is the measurement of the grill’s power. This affects how high a temperature the grill can reach and how fast it reaches the desired temperature.

Higher wattage can also mean faster cooking, but not all foods require extremely high temperatures or they don’t need to be cooked really quickly.

<h3>1.<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YD99Y4?tag=brobbq-grill-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddler</a></h3>

Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddler"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>We’ll start with a great indoor grill for steaks that is not only that, but it’s like five cooking devices in one. The power of the unit can be guessed from its very name and the brand, who have been offering affordable and easy-to-use kitchen appliances ever since.

This one is an all-inclusive unit that emphasizes on convenience above everything else. This is an appliance that can be easily operated and does not require too much maintenance.

And there are lots of accessories to choose from if you go to the brand’s website. From utensils to cleaning tools, there’s everything you need to become a better griller.

The model is not that expensive, so you won’t be breaking the bank if you buy some accessories for it.

While larger grills certainly do an excellent job cooking food, they may require a lot of maintenance and might take a lot of time to set up. Plus, cleaning up after using them is a chore.

With this bbq grill, on the other hand, you can cook delicious food in a matter of minutes. Whatever your favorite food is, you can almost certainly cook it with this indoor grill so whether you are craving for chicken breasts or burgers, you’ll get bistro quality ones right in your house.

Since it’s so small and light, you can use it anywhere, too, from the top of the counter to the dining table.

The model has cast iron grilling plates, with porcelain enamel. Unlike the traditional cast iron, these do not require seasoning and, since the surface is non-stick, they are very easy to clean plus the enamel is thick enough to handle high temperatures.

There are disadvantages to using porcelain-enameled cast iron, however. The first one is that it takes a little long to heat up. It may take up to twenty minutes for the grill to reach the desired temperature.

But once it gets there, it maintains the heat quite well.

The enamel can get chipped if you use sharp cooking utensils, such as those made of steel. For this reason, we recommend that you use silicone or wooden utensils.

The unit has three knobs for selecting the temperature. The first one is for the griddle and the temperature ranges from 200 to 425 °F.

The second knob is a selector with which you can switch the temperature between griddle and grill. And the third knob has five heating cores that go from warm to sear.

The five ways in which you can use this unit allow you to cook a wide assortment of foods without compromising on flavor. To change between the different options, all you need to do is unlatch the locks located in each side of the grill, turn the plates over and slide them back in.

This grill is definitely not just for grilling: you can use it as a contact grill, which is great for chicken breast, hamburgers or steaks, as a wide open grill, to double the amount of grilling space, as a panini press, an extra large griddler and as half griddle and half grill.

With all the versatility you can get from this grill, it’s no wonder that this is a top rated indoor grill.

You can cook, shrimp, steaks, salmon and even Paninis with everything turning out great.

The unit is small and well-designed. Assembling it takes almost no time, and cleaning it is very easy, too.

In fact, one of the best aspects of this grill is how easy the cleaning process is and how fast you can get it over with. The grill plates are removable and can be put in the dishwasher, and the drip tray, too.

As we said, it can be used for cooking different foods and performs really well thanks to its clamshell design that helps it do its job really quickly by providing heat from above and below.Burgers are ready in about three minutes, and the grill is also good for vegetables and other types of meats.

This is a great smokeless indoor grill that lets you get a good sear without setting off any smoke alarms. It can reach temperatures of up to 500 °F.

Although you will not be cooking extremely large meals on the unit, its cooking surface can accommodate up to six burger patties, so it should be enough to cook dinner for the whole family.

However, the only problem with the unit is that the grease spatter flies far, which leads to inconvenience.

George Foreman GRP4EMB Multi-Plate Evolve Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This indoor grill aims to take care not only of your grilling needs, but you can also use it to deep-dish bake, or even cook muffins. It’s affordable, versatile and easy to use.

For everything you can do with it, it has the best price too.

The unit has an attractive design and the materials feel of high quality. The cooking plates are solid but not too heavy, and they attach easily, so that you won’t have to waste any time setting it up.

It’s built in a combination of metal and plastic, but it does feel like this grill is made to last.

One obvious benefit of the unit, aside from the high quality construction, is that you’ll be able to use it not just for grilling. With the interchangeable plates, you’ll be able to cook different kinds of foods.

The standard grill plate is just as good as you would expect, and it’s slanted so that the fat drips onto the dripping tray. The result of this design is that food is cooked with far less fat.

It’s perfect if you’re on a low fat diet. You can perfectly cook a steak with little fat and while retaining all of its moisture.

With the deep dish tray, you can cook bread, pizza, vegetables, or just about anything you want to put in there. The cupcake and muffin tray looks just like a regular tray of its kind, but it’s been designed to fit the grill and the attachment is great for making muffins in small batches.

The grilling process is simple. There isn’t a lot of mess thanks to the dripping tray and it’s very easy to clean up.

The removable cooking plates can be put in the dishwasher, which is something you probably won’t have to do every time, since you can just use paper towels to clean this up.

The model will reach full temperature in about five minutes, and it will maintain whatever temperature you select. There is also a timer included, so you can ensure perfect cooking times.

Baking cupcakes and muffins is just as easy and the results you’ll get are just as good as those you’d get in a conventional oven.

You do have to be careful with the amount you pour into the deep dish tray, though. If you put too much in there, it might overflow and create a bit of a mess.

The overall construction of the tray is high quality. Although relatively affordable, it is of a high standard.

The cooking trays and release handles feel sturdy, which is important because the whole idea is that you’ll be switching those out very often. Even in case of any problems, the tray accessories can be purchased separately, and you can get additional ones.

T-fal GC702 OptiGrill Stainless Steel Indoor Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>The unit is designed to help you cook food to perfection with its six preset programs and its precision grilling technology, with sensors that calculate the thickness of the food and adapt the grilling cycles accordingly.

Although, for this to work well, the pieces of food to be cooked have to be of a more or less even thickness.

You simply choose a program based on what kind of food you’re cooking: burger, poultry, sandwich, red meat or fish, and the grill will tell you when it’s done. Isn’t that just the best way to grill indoors?

Another neat feature of this grill is its frozen food mode, which lets you take a steak out of the freezer and put it on the grill without having to wait for it to thaw. This makes it a great indoor grill for steaks too.

But you don’t always have to let the unit take over for you. It also has a manual setting that lets you select the temperature and the cooking time.

This is useful when you’re grilling vegetables or for specific recipes that require settings other than the ones programmed in the grill.

It has non-stick die-cast aluminum grill plates, which are easy to remove, easy to clean and are also dishwasher safe. They are slightly angled to help make the grease flow down to the drip tray, which is large and can also be thrown in the dishwasher.

George Foreman 15-Serving Indoor Outdoor Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" />The grill blends convenience and function. Set up is fairly easy, and the built is very sturdy.

In the box you will find the grill itself, a removable grilling plate, a grease tray, the domed lid with an adjustable vent, a power cord which includes the temperature control and a stand.

The stand is made out of plastic and aluminum, and the stabilizing legs all clip together, so you won’t need any tools when putting it together. Since the stand is removable, you’ll be able to take this grill from the backyard to the countertop in no time, making it a great indoor and outdoor grill.

The grill plate has a non-stick coating to make it durable; easy to clean and to let you cook without using butter or oil.

With the five individual heat settings of the brand, you can cook using slow heat or you can set it to searing temperatures.

The temperature control will be a familiar experience if you’ve used a gas grill in the past, and a new experience that you’re likely to welcome if you’ve only used charcoal grills. Whatever you want to cook, you’ll be able to easily adjust the temperature for it.

Thanks to the electronic controls, heat is perfectly maintained, and the grill has the ability to self-regulate by turning the heating element on or off.

There is no need for you to intervene, you just set the temperature and let it do what it has to do.

You’ll also get the versatility of outdoor and indoor grilling. You can use it outside with the included stand or put on you counter, a picnic table or another heat-resistant surface.

It won’t be a problem, since the body of grill itself has feet at the bottom. And it’s lightweight enough for you to take tailgating or on any excursions although being too light brings in the risk of the unit toppling when placed on a stand.

The construction of the grill is also done with two materials, just like the stand. The quality of the materials seems appropriate for the price range, but that is not to say that they are of bad or cheap quality.

Aluminum is used for the cooking surface and the lid. The cooking surface is coated in high quality Teflon, which is scratch resistant when used with wooden or plastic utensils.

It features a wide cooking surface that lets you cook many food items at the same time.

Chicken and hamburgers will come out juicy and delicious. You can cook a variety of foods with little mess thanks to its non-stick surface.

Although grilling times are a little longer than on other grills, the surface can be easily cleaned. All you have to do it is give it a wipe.

The drip tray is removable and can also be cleaned pretty easily.

The grill has a tempered glass lid, which helps keep the heat in while cooking, making for juicier and more tender meat. It also helps keep the food warm until it’s time to serve it.

It comes with a detachable thermostat, which is great because it lets you easily choose the desired cooking temperature. The temperatures are not always consistent across the entire cooking surface, however.

Despite this, it can still cook food thoroughly.

The die-cast aluminum grilling grate is large enough to cook for several people at once, but the cooking surface is smaller than other grills. This allows the grill to be light and portable, though, and the carrying handles do not get hot, so it can be easily picked up and transported.

This grill is good for so many things and it does them so well. It’s easy to clean, durable, relatively light weight, extremely convenient and comes in one elegant design.

There are plenty of meat dishes that can be grilled on this, and also vegetables or seafood. It’s also a great indoor grill for Korean BBQ.

The large surface of the cast iron grilling area can take some heavy cooking and there is an adjustable temperature management system, which lets you easily adjust how high you want it to be. The material that the grilling area is made of naturally holds heat very well, for optimum performance.

No matter how hot the unit might get, the cool touch carrying handles let you transport the grill without danger of getting burned.

All the extra fat and oils in the food you cook go straight into the large, removable drip tray, which is dishwasher safe.

This round grill can handle your burgers, chops, steaks, and vegetables easily.

There’s only one cooking surface, so this is definitely not a contact grill.

The glass lid is helpful for times when you want to speed up cooking, do some steaming, or keep foods warm for serving.

The power cord is removable, so the whole grill can be taken to the table for serving, and the grill plate is removable for easy cleaning.

It has five different heat settings for cooking different foods.

The downside of this grill is that the plastic knob on the lid can be a little fragile and the grill itself is not as sturdy as more expensive grills, although the build quality is perfectly fine for its price point.

So, here are some of the best ones for 2018:

<h2>Is a Charcoal Grill What You Precisely Need?</h2>
Many people get lost in the dilemma of charcoal and gas and have trouble deciding which type of grill to get.

Let’s go about it the simple way: If you value taste over convenience, then there is no doubt that you should go for charcoal. There are advantages to using gas, but there is nothing like the smoky taste briquettes or natural wood charcoal can provide. If you value convenience over anything else, I think you should read about the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-gas-charcoal-combo-grill/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best gas charcoal combo grills</a>

So, now that you know charcoal is the way to go for the best taste, there remains the question of which charcoal grill to buy? And even after you’ve bought one, you might still wonder about the best way to use it.

That is not always so easy, and there are some things to consider like the following:
<h3>Lump Charcoal or Briquettes</h3>
Lump charcoal and briquettes are really two different things. Lumps are made from burning wood without oxygen; the charcoal is what remains after that.

It will light easier and burn hotter. Briquettes are made from wood by-products mixed with additives to help them burn longer and maintain a consistent temperature.

Lumps are natural, but they tend to be more expensive and burn out more quickly. Briquettes are anything but natural, but they are usually cheaper and the fact they can burn for longer times makes them a more popular choice.
<h3>How Much Charcoal to Use?</h3>
The amount of charcoal to use is something that often goes overlooked. Generally, it depends on the size of the grill you’re using.

Larger grills will obviously require more charcoal. The more charcoal you use, the hotter the fire will be and you should bear in mind different types of food need different amounts of heat.

As a guide, your grill should be about two thirds covered.
<h3>How to Light a Charcoal Grill?</h3>
One of the most popular ways to light a charcoal grill is with a little lighter fluid. This will generally work but it is recommended to leave enough time for the fuel and chemicals to completely burn off, or the food will end up having “lighter fluid taste”.

To light it up, the charcoal can be piled up in a heap. Once all of the charcoal is lit up and the fire is burning evenly, the charcoal can be spread out.

Some people prefer to use a chimney charcoal starter. It’s easy to light up charcoal in one of these because all of it is confined in a small space.

After being lit up, the charcoal can be transferred to the grill. And, then, of course, there are some grills that include an electrical or gas ignition system, making the job even easier.

If you need a charcoal grill that light-weight enough to bring it everywhere you want, then I think you might want to see this article about <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-portable-charcoal-grills/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best portable charcoal grills</a>

Weber 741001 Original Kettle 22-Inch Charcoal Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>We begin with a classic from one of the oldest and most respected manufacturers of grills and grill-related accessories. This one is a great grill under $100, which is definitely a competitive price point.

The design has changed over the years; they still follow the principle of combining features, ease of use and simplicity. It strikes a blend of tradition and innovation at the same time, offering a great grilling experience.

The features of this grill make it stand out from other grills and that is why this is a top rated Weber charcoal grill. It has plenty of space, a large cooking surface for you to do those really big and great BBQs.

Cleaning is easy and simple, with an aluminized steel ash catcher which does not let all the ash float around the place. Cleaning is also equally easier after cooking.
The grill’s body is completely resistant to rust. This is very important because it means the grill will last you for a long time.

This tabletop charcoal grill includes an aluminum damper and two high-quality nylon handles which are glass-reinforced, and even have hooks for your cooking utensils.

All in all, this is one of the most enjoyable models, and a quite inexpensive charcoal grill.

Dyna-Glo DGN576SNC-D Dual Zone Premium Charcoal Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one is a heavy-duty charcoal grill that is meant to last. It is made for those grillers who specialize in cooking for really large gatherings.

Extra-large, premium quality, as the name states, and striking. This is a lot of grill for the money.

This brand makes grills that are at the high end, and this is no exception. So, you know you’ll be getting good quality equipment here.

The cooking area has two different charcoal trays, which is a plus. With this feature, it’s almost as if you have two separate cooking areas, and each tray is removable, so they can be easily cleaned.

There is a steel divider that lets you separate the firebox in two parts. This means you’ll get two cooking areas where the heat can be adjusted separately.

Each tray can be independently lowered or raised to get a different temperature on each side.

Of course, having two separate areas means that you can grill with a lot more flexibility. You can grill different types of food, for example or use one side to cook and the other side to finish off and keep the food warm, while you put the next batch on the first side.

And if you’re cooking for a smaller group of people, you don’t have to use charcoal on the whole grilling area.

The firebox has two cast iron and steel doors, one for each side. There are also independent air vents for each of the two sides, so you get even more heat control.

The cooking grates are made of cast iron, which is great for heat retention. They are coated with porcelain enamel, which helps to transfer the heat to the food.

They are easy to handle and clean, since they are split. You won’t have to deal with one large grate.

The lid is stainless-steel, which gives it an attractive look and also helps protect the interior of the grill. It has a galvanized steel double wall, which keeps the heat in and prevents it from getting too hot to touch from the outside.

Even though this is a very large grill, it is still portable, as grills of this size go. It has heavy-duty resin wheels, so it shouldn’t be too hard to take it from one place to another.

However, assembling it from the scratch can be quite a task just like controlling the temperature is a bit tricky too.

PK Grills The Original PK Grill &amp; Smoker"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This unit, also known as the Portable Kitchen Grill, is built with a design that goes back to the 1950s, and just like grills of those days, it’s made from hand-poured cast aluminum.

This rust-proof charcoal grill has a flat bottom making it easy to push the coals to one side for smoking and indirect cooking. The lid has adjustable dampers for temperature control.

The quite large grilling grate is hinged, convenient for easily adding charcoal.The unit has a side shelf, where you can place the food to be cooked and a bottom shelf, for storing charcoal bags and other things.

Designed to be tough and durable, the model is designed with the very first aluminum grills in mind. There are very few moving parts and, so the idea is that this grill will be in service for a long time, just like the grills of old times, many of which are still used today.

The unit can be used with charcoal briquettes or hardwood lump charcoal, and it performs well with both, whether you’re doing fast grilling or slow barbecuing.

Temperature control is fairly simple on this grill. Thick cast aluminum and four-way venting make for a very efficient cooking chamber.
It can also hold steady temperatures for a long time and it lets you use the same charcoal for multiple cooks.

The cooking unit can also be detached from the stand and turned into a fully portable charcoal grill ideal for camping, tailgating and other types of excursions, adding to its versatility.

Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Kettleman"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This is another grill of good size that is also made by one of the top grill manufacturers with over seventy years of experience.

You’ll have plenty of room for lots of food, you can put up to fifteen hamburgers in at the same time, so if your family is large or if you’re having lots of people over, you’ll have no problem cooking for all of them with this budget charcoal grill.

The cooking grate is coated with porcelain, which helps distribute the heat and reduces the risk of flare-ups by allowing the flavor of the charcoal to pass through to the food while keeping the flames away from it.

The body of the firebox has air vents to allow the air to flow in all around. That way, the air increases the fire from all sides and that keeps it evenly spread heating up the whole cooking surface.

The large air vents on top of the lid help control the temperature. Opening these vents makes the inside of the gill a little cooler, and closing it increases the temperature inside.

The included thermometer lets you know if your food needs more or less heat, and the lid itself is hinged for simple opening and closing when you want to check how done your food is.

Everything in the unit’s design points towards efficient burning. Plus, the grill has Char-Broil’s own Tru-Infrared cooking system, which further helps with better heat distribution and temperature control, and it lets the grill cook food more evenly while using less charcoal.

And don’t worry about cleaning up any ashy messes. The removable ash tray at the bottom of the grill collects all the ash so it can be easily disposed of while also being large enough.

Weber 15501001 Performer Deluxe"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one is the deluxe version of the Weber Original Kettle, and it shares some similarities with it, but it takes grilling to a whole new level. That means this is not a cheap charcoal grill so, let’s see if it’s worth spending a little more.

The enamel on the bowl and lid is super tough, and the grilling surface is the same size as the Original Kettle. The grilling plate is hinged, so it’s easy to get to the charcoal should you need to stroke it or add more.

This grill comes with Weber’s Touch-n-Go gas ignition system. You don’t need matches or lighter fluid to get the charcoal burning.

This system does that for you. You can get the fire going with just one touch, hence the name.

That does not mean this is a gas grill. It just uses gas to light up the charcoal.

There are two charcoal baskets, and they can be placed at the edge of the drum or in the middle of it. This helps control the amount of smoke that gets to the food, and gives you the option to use direct or indirect cooking.

The lid has a thermometer built into it, so it’s easy to check the temperature inside the grill. A digital timer is also included.

The handle on the lid does not get hot while the grill is in use, so you can remove it and put it back in place without worrying about getting burned.

Also on the lid, there are rust-resistant dampers to control the temperature, and the lid itself can be held to act like a windshield by means of a lid holder.

You’ll also notice the steel cart frame, which is a great addition, since it provides an area where you can put the food you’ve grilled, or the food you’re about to grill. It also has hooks for hanging your cooking tools.

The bottom part of the cart can also be used to store your charcoal when the grill is not in use although removing the ash tray can be bit of a tough task.

Dyna-Glo DGN576DNC-D Premium"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>As is usually the case with the grills of this particular brand, this one too is meant for serious grilling enthusiasts. Its size and price point are, however, a little beyond what is usually found in regular home grills.

This is for when you’re holding a large outdoor party. This is a heavy-duty grill that is well designed and meant to last.

It’s not a small investment, so let’s see how much you’ll get for what you’ll be paying if you go for this grill.

There are more expensive grill models, but this one is still considered one of the finest ones.

The unit offers heat control, which is necessary to get perfectly grilled food, with a crank handle that lets you raise and lower the charcoal basket. The access door to the basket is made of cast iron, which is great for keeping the heat inside.

The cooking grates can be slid from side to side, so they can go after the heat. More heat control comes from the stainless steel smoke stack and side dampers, which allow you to control the air flow and therefore the temperature.

These parts of the grill are also meant to help you control the flavor of your food by regulating how much smoke you want on it.

The cooking surface is made of cast iron with a porcelain enamel. The cast iron maximizes heat transfer and the porcelain enamel makes it easy to clean.

It is quite a large grilling surface, enough to fit up to thirty hamburgers at once.

Two side shelves offer more space, and there is a basket underneath the unit that is good for storage. In there you can keep cooking utensils, plates, or even the food that you’re going to cook.

There is even a little extra touch: a bottle opener fixed on the side, so you and your guests can enjoy cold drinks while waiting for the food.

Char-Griller 2-2424 Table Top Charcoal Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one is a great table top charcoal grill for those times where you just want to cook food fast, but for its size and weight it also works great as a camping charcoal grill, or for picnicking with your family, or for anywhere you want to take it.

It has a durable construction that is sure to resist all the elements and is sure to last for a long time. It can also be used as a side fire box, when attached to a compatible barrel grill of the same brand.

It’s made of heavy steel which is a durable material, so you won’t have to worry about it when you’re carrying it around. Take it anywhere as it is a great small charcoal grill that is well built and comes at an affordable price.

The size of the unit means it won’t take up too much space. This makes it perfect if you’re a little bit constrained for space and also makes it easier to find a place to store it.

This grill is ideal for grilling at tailgate parties, at the beach or when camping and also for when you’re grilling for just a few people.

It comes fully assembled, so you don’t even have to think about putting it together. Cleaning it is not a problem, either.

It has a removable ash tray that can be detached to get rid of all the unwanted coal residue and ash.
The entire body of the grill is coated in porcelain, so you can give it a clean look just by wiping off the dirt and dust.

The grilling grates are made of cast iron and they are larger than what most grills of this size and price have to offer. It has adjustable dampers to control the heat.

This is another feature that is usually only found in more expensive grills. You really get a lot of value in this little grill, which is also a charcoal grill under $200.

With this model, you get the versatility of using it by itself or as a firebox attached to another Char-Griller grill. You should note, however, that once attached to a larger grill, it can no longer be used as a table top grill so the design does have its limitations.

<h2>Is Using a Gas Grill a Good Choice?</h2>
Gas grills offer some benefits over charcoal grills like the following:
<h3>Very Convenient</h3>
Gas grilling is extremely convenient as you have the ability to control the flame, and therefore the temperature, at the turn of a knob. Gas grills use propane gas, which comes in refillable tanks, as their fuel source.
<h3>More Authentic</h3>
Gas grills are often considered more authentic because the flavor of the grilled food is better with these than the charcoal ones.
<h3>Cleaner and Quicker</h3>
Gas grilling is also clean and quick. There is no messing around with of briquettes, no handling of smelly starter fluid and no waiting around for the coal to get to the desired burning point and all these are particularly relevant for the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-natural-gas-grills/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best natural gas grills</a>.

In addition, once you’re done grilling, there are no ashes left behind to clean up. You simply turn it off, run a metal brush through it or stick the grates in the dish washer and you’re done.

Since gas burns clean, gas grills can also be used in areas where there is a burn ban and charcoal cannot be used.

So, if it is overall convenience you’re after, then a gas grill is definitely the right choice.
<h2>Factors to Consider in Choosing Gas Grills</h2>
There are three main things that you should look for in a gas grill:
<h3>Even Heat Distribution</h3>
No griller likes hot-spots. A grill that has some really hot areas and some cooler areas makes cooking very difficult.

Even heat distribution throughout the whole grill surface allows food to cook evenly. It also gives you the ability to use your grill like an oven and roast or bake food, which you automatically learn when you know <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-a-gas-grill/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">how to use a gas grill</a>.

Gas grills achieve even heat distribution by using high-quality tube burners, a well-insulated hood that locks in heat and efficiently circulates air, and heavy-duty cooking grates that transfer heat well.
<h3>Durability</h3>
A gas grill is definitely an investment. A quality gas grill should last for very many years, not just a few months.

That means they should be built from heavy-gauge and corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel and thick porcelain enameled steel. Well-built grills also retain heat better, which allows them to maintain an even cooking temperature, even in cold weather.
<h3>Safe Operation</h3>
You should be able to use your grill without having to worry about gas leaks or flare-ups. This means all the fittings and parts must be secure while drippings and juices from your food must be directed away from the direct flames.

And, of course, when choosing a grill, you should also consider how and where you’ll be using it. If you want it for backyard grilling or if you undertake many excursions and therefore, prefer one of the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-portable-gas-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best portable gas grills</a>.

Weber 46510001 Spirit E310 Liquid Propane Gas Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>It comes with all the features that any griller would want to have, and it is reasonably priced. It comes from a manufacturer known for paying attention to all details, so you can be sure you’re getting a quality product that is sure to last.

This grill provides an ample main cooking surface, plus a warming rack and two stainless steel side tables for extra space where you can place your spices or prepare your food. No more running to the table and back, you can conveniently have it all in one place.

The side tables can be folded down when the grill is not in use.

It also comes with Weber’s own porcelain enameled flavorizer bars. This is a system that was introduced to allow for cooking juices, such as grease and butter to sizzle and evaporate when they fall, adding flavor to your food.

The grill requires a twenty-pound propane gas tank, which can be conveniently kept inside the cabinet. There is a gauge that lets you know how much fuel you have left at all times.

As for the cooking grates, they are made of cast iron and are also enameled in porcelain. The cast iron provides better heat retention, and no seasoning is necessary.

Cleaning the grates is super easy, too.

The cook box is made of aluminum and it’s efficient and durable. The model can withstand high temperatures, so you can cook any kind of meat. When the lid is down, that helps with heat circulation and the food retains all its aroma and flavors.

This is a good grill with many features and a relatively low price.

It is one of the most powerful gas grills on the market.

The four burners deliver a lot of heating power across the cooking surface. It’s a large cooking surface, so it can definitely use all that power.

You won’t be missing any features here. In fact, there are some features that you may not even find in more expensive grills.

The build quality is excellent. It’s all metal, with a stainless steel lid, handle and front panel, which promises a stylish look and durability.

The grilling grate of the primary cooking surface is made of porcelain coated cast iron, great for heat retention and easy to clean and maintain. In case its large size of the primary surface is not enough, it also has a swing-away secondary cooking surface, which is also coated in porcelain.

In addition, it includes a side burner, so you can cook your favorite side dishes and sauces while you’re grilling. The side burner has a lid, so it can also double as a side panel if you need more prep space instead.

Although the unit is large and leans towards the heavy side, it does come with wheels, to make it easier to move around, should you ever wish to.

You’ll get style; durability and function in an excellent grill under 300 dollars. However, it’s too large a size and increased space consumption is a matter of inconvenience for many.

This unit comes under the category of the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-2-burner-gas-grills/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best 2 burner gas grills</a>, in fact, it has an extra stainless steel made burner. They provide a huge amount of power, and since they are dual tube, they can provide twice the heat of normal burners, even at low temperatures

This means faster grilling, and is a feature that has been patented by the particular brand.

The cooking grates are made of heavy-duty cast iron, coated with porcelain, which makes them resistant to rust and prevents food from sticking. These are reversible, so you can use one side to cook a delicious steak or flip the grates to the grooved side if you want to grill beef patties.

The unit also includes a side burner and this is a grill with rotisserie kit included. It is located in the lid and can cook up to two whole chickens at the same time although the rotisserie add-on can be removed if you want.

There are also two spacious side panels (one of them doubles as the side burner), which give you space to prep, hang your utensils or put your spices and food.

Cleaning the grill might be just about the only thing that isn’t so great about it. It does take a lot of time, but that is not surprising given the size of the grill and all the parts it has.

For starters, there are those six burners. If that’s not enough, it also has porcelain enameled cast iron cooking grates, solid steel prep tables, one of which is also a side burner, a stainless steel lid with handle, a temperature gauge, a grease drip tray and four casters.

The cooking grates are designed to retain heat, be easy to clean and reduce flare-ups. The porcelain enamel ensures the food doesn’t stick to them and that no seasoning is required.

No more scrubbing the surface of the grates. All you need is water, a cloth and a mild brush to wipe out any food residue.

The grill has a warming rack that is also coated in porcelain, so it also preserves the heat quite well, and since its right above the main cooking area, food is kept warm there for a long time.

A double lid is found on the model. This not only prevents the heat from escaping, but also helps preserve the food’s flavor.

There is a thermometer on the lid, so you know exactly at what temperature your food is being cooked.

The grill itself is made of stainless steel, and that includes the lid, the knobs, the cabinet doors and the burners. The burners are shaped like a “U”, and, of course, there is no chance of them rusting because of the material they’re made of, which is always a plus.

The bottom part of the grill has cabinet with two doors at the front. In there you can keep the gas tank as well as grilling tools.

It’s really convenient, since you can have them all in one place and you don’t have to go looking around for them every time you’re going to use your grill.

All said and done, its too heavy weight can create much of a problem.

And that is fine, because it is strong and feels well-built and sturdy and will surely have no trouble to take some roughness out on the trips with you.

The lid is built in painted porcelain, and it has sturdy steel legs which provide a lot of stability. These legs cannot be folded or removed, however, so whenever you’re transporting it, the legs will be sticking out.

That also means it takes more storage space, but it works great as an RV propane grill.

The cooking surface, with a porcelain coated wire grate, is large enough for eight burgers, or two to three steaks. You and your family will not go hungry on those camping trips.

And you’ll be able to monitor the temperature at all times with the included thermometer.

Because of its size, the unit can only feature one single burner, but the lid has some depth, meaning that heat will flow inside and you should have no problem cooking your food.

All in all, this is grill has good quality, is easy to use and campers and hikers will appreciate its rugged design.

3393,"5 Best Outdoor Electric Grills 2018 : For Patio & Small Place","A lot people who love the flavor of grilled food just don’t have the space for a large unit or the time to grill with charcoal. In that case, you might be considering buying some of the best outdoor electric grills.

Electric models are a handy alternative to traditional grilling. They are also ideal for people who love cooking outdoors but don't want to deal with the hassle of propane or charcoal.

If you’re interested in finding a safe and more convenient way to grill on weekends and holidays, then you should take a look at the several electric unit options that are available on the market. The technology has advanced a lot in recent times, so it’s not like you’ll be missing out on a lot by getting one of these.

So, we want to help you get the best grill and therefore, review some of the best units available out there for 2018.
[supsystic-tables id=31]

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3406"" title=""best outdoor electric grills"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/best-outdoor-electric-grills.jpg"" alt=""best outdoor electric grills"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />
<h2>Why an Outdoor Electric Grill is a Right Choice for You?</h2>
An electric grill stands out from the other available options in many respects, some of which includes the following:
<h3>Small in Size &amp; Portable</h3>
Traditional gas and charcoal grills come in a wide variety of styles and designs: there are large multi-burner gas units with built-in islands and there are barrel-style charcoal grills. But they might just be too large or too inconvenient for some people as opposed to electric grills that promise enhanced portability.
<h3>No Need of Propane</h3>
Gas-based models are certainly handy, but some people find it too dangerous to cook with propane. Charcoal units might feel safer in that respect, but they do take considerable time to light and prepare, and cleaning up afterward can be messy.

Besides, some apartments and condos ban the use of propane or charcoal altogether.
<h3>Hassle-Free &amp; Easy to Use</h3>
Electric grills get rid of all of these concerns. They have instant-on controls, easy-to-clean designs, and no smelly gas or messy charcoal to get in the way of your cooking.

Plus, there will be no smoke and you don’t have to worry about ever running out of fuel, since all you need to do is plug them in to a standard outlet.
<h3>Perfect for Outdoor Usage</h3>
Cooking on a deck or balcony in your apartment is also much easier with an electric grill. Cooking in winter is also easier if you’re in a covered area.

So, you could grill during the autumn and winter when most people just don’t want to go through the effort of priming their charcoal or firing up a gas burner in the middle of the cold weather.

Kenyon B70082 Floridian All Seasons Portable Stainless Steel Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This is a rather interesting item and it has gotten great reviews. This is a grill that you’ll probably try if you have a couple of extra dollars lying around, though.

Let’s see if its set of features is worth paying a high price for. This small electric BBQ grill runs on a regular 120 volt outlet.

It comes with a built-in GFS circuit breaker for extra safety. The grill has been called the Kenyon electric boat grill, as it apparently has become pretty popular with boat lovers.

People also have found it convenient for use in their RVs.

The grate of any grill is a very important part of it. That is, of course, the surface where the food is cooked, and it can make a difference between deliciously tasting food and something that comes out of the grill tasting “just okay”.

The grill grate of the model is covered with a high quality non stick material. The heating element is located right under.

The performance of the heating element is exceptional and it provides a very even heat distribution.

The grilling surface is 155 square inches and that should give you enough room to grill for several people while remaining small enough for portability and easy storage.

With 1300 watts of power, the unit has no problems when it comes to providing all the necessary heat needed. It can go to 600 °F in only ten minutes.

This lets you not only cook faster, but is good for saving electricity, which is particular useful when you’re using the electric power on a boat or RV.

One of the features that has probably made the unit popular among boat lovers is the fact that it its build quality allows it to be water proof. Since it’s made of stainless steel of higher quality, it can withstand being exposed to salty environments without rusting or looking beat up after just a few weeks.

Security has also been taken into consideration. Since it’s electric, there may be a concern about electric shocks while using it and therefore, the grill comes with a GFCI to get rid of such a risk.

Cleaning the grill is a breeze. All you need to do is wipe it using a paper towel and you’re done.

This is best done right after the gill has cooled down, though, otherwise, you might need to scrub a little harder. The cooking grate is dishwasher safe, so cleaning that is also really easy.

Considering all of this, the only really negative thing to say about it is that it’s really expensive. It is more expensive than most electric grills, and in fact it’s even more expensive than full sized gas and charcoal grills.

But if you live in a condo or like to enjoy grilled goods on your boat or RV, and you can spare a few bucks, then this grill is worth a try. It’s a high investment, but it’s sure to last for a long time.

Cuisinart CEG-980 Outdoor Electric Grill with VersaStand"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>The unit actually comes in two variants. One with the stand and one without.

You do have to pay a little bit extra for the stand, but not too much. It’s really a matter of personal choice if you want to use this grill on as an electric patio grill or as a tabletop electric grill.

This is a portable electric grill with a grilling surface of 145 square inches, which is enough to cook eight hamburgers or chicken breast or about four pounds of fish. Naturally, it’s also good for steak; you can fit about eight of them.

The grill has a powerful 1,500 watts, 5,120 BTU burner to cook juicy steaks, burgers, and fish just. Thanks to this burner, heat is spread quickly and evenly through the grill grate, which is enameled with porcelain, so food doesn’t stick to it and is easy to clean.

The compact design creates a greater watt-to-square-inch ratio, which means higher temperatures on the grate and better, more uniformly cooked food. The grill also has a stainless-steel heat reflector in the lid.

The extra layer acts as an insulator that traps heat inside the grill, and reflects rising heat inside the grill back onto the top surfaces of your food, reducing cooking times and saving electricity.

It’s also great for when you’re on the move, as the grill is super easy to transport, set up, and store. It has an easy-to-use, easy-to-set-up grill stand that keeps the grill at a comfortable cooking height.

The stand easily collapses for when you need to store it. There is also includes a secure front lid lock, which keeps the lid safely closed when the grill is being moved around, and the handle lets you carry the grill just like a briefcase.

However, the surface heating up way too much can cause inconvenience especially when cooking outdoors.

Weber 52020001 Q1400 Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This grill is a great alternative if you’re looking for an authentic grilling experience without any of the hassles of a larger grill. It’s suitable for every home, and it’s so easy to use and clean that it could even be used for daily meals.

The cooking surface is 189 square inches, which is a decent size. If you’re cooking for a family or if you’re having a small gathering at your home, this grill will give you more than enough space to work with.

One thing to consider about the size is you’re not going to be cooking a full-sized chicken or turkey on this grill. A smaller whole chicken will fit inside the grill, but you will get better results cooking smaller, individual pieces.

Full size racks and roast cuts of meat will also not be suitable for this grill. This is another compromise that needs to be made with a smaller grill.

As long as you are working with smaller cuts you won’t have difficulties, and for the average family this will not be a problem.

When you take the model out of the box, you will immediately notice how simple this grill is. There is just a single temperature control probe, which plugs into the side of the grill.

It’s easy to adjust and it also feels to be solid and of high quality.

The cooking surface is good enough to perfectly cook all of your favorites like vegetables, steak, sausages and hot dogs, burgers, and chicken pieces. You have a good amount of control over the temperature, so you will be able to get it just right for whateveryou’re cooking.

There are no individual temperature zones on this grill, so different types of food will have to be cooked separately, or constantly check to make sure that some food is not getting burned while another is still cooking. This grill cooks better with the lid down.

One drawback is that the power cord is just six feet long. This is fine for times when you’re using it as a countertop electric grill, but you will probably need an extension cord when you use this grill outside.

George Foreman 15-Serving Indoor Outdoor Electric Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This particular grill blends convenience and function. Set up is fairly easy, and the built is very sturdy.

In the box you will find the grill itself, a removable grilling plate, a grease tray, the domed lid with an adjustable vent, a power cord which includes the temperature control and a stand.

The stand is made out of plastic and aluminum, and the stabilizing legs all clip together, so you won’t need any tools when putting it together. Since the stand is removable, you’ll be able to take this grill from the backyard to the countertop in no time, making it a great indoor and outdoor grill.

The grill plate has a non-stick coating to make it durable; easy to clean and to let you cook without using butter or oil.

With the five individual heat settings of this grill, you can cook using slow heat or you can set it to searing temperatures.

The temperature control will be a familiar experience if you’ve used a gas grill in the past, and a new experience that you’re likely to welcome if you’ve only used charcoal grills. Whatever you want to cook, you’ll be able to easily adjust the temperature for it.
Thanks to the electronic controls, heat is perfectly maintained, and the grill has the ability to self-regulate by turning the heating element on or off. There is no need for you to intervene, you just set the temperature and let it do what it has to do.

You’ll also get the versatility of outdoor and indoor grilling. You can use it outside with the included stand or put on you counter, a picnic table or another heat-resistant surface.

It won’t be a problem, since the body of grill itself has feet at the bottom. And it’s lightweight enough for you to take tailgating or on any excursions.

The construction of the grill is also done with two materials, just like the stand. The quality of the materials seems appropriate for the price range, but that is not to say that they are of bad or cheap quality.

Aluminum is used for the cooking surface and the lid. The cooking surface is coated in high quality Teflon, which is scratch resistant when used with wooden or plastic utensils. All in all, the build is rather good with the major concern being its lightweightness that causes risks of toppling.

Easy Street Electric Cart Grill With Two Folding"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one certainly is an interesting looking grill. There isn’t anything that quite looks like it in the world of electric grills.

If you didn’t know it’s an electric grill, you’d probably assume it was a charcoal grill.

Not only does it look good, it works well, too. It feels like a real grill, as it should.

Assembly is quick and easy. You should be able to get it up and running in less than an hour.

The model comes with two foldable wooden side tables where you can put your condiments and utensils, so you don’t have to be running to the table and back. That’s a nice touch that not many compact grills include.

There is a little window on the lid, so you don’t have to be constantly opening it to check on your food, which can cause the temperature to drop considerably.

The heating element of the unit is another interesting thing. It can be used to create an even heat zone for traditional grilling, a versatile cooking zone with different temperatures and can be converted to fully vertical position for rotisserie.

And there is another nice touch of this grill: the included rotisserie attachment. You just load the chicken into the grill and let it cook.

It’s super simple. In addition to all that, the rolling cart makes transport of this grill extremely convenient.

<h2>Reviews of the best pellet smokers/grills</h2>
<h3>1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5YFF7W?tag=brobbq-pellet-smoker-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Green Mountain Davy Crockett Pellet Grill – WIFI enabled</a></h3>

Green Mountain Grills Davy Crockett Pellet Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This excellent pellet smoker under $500 with a unique design has found its way into our list and we love it!

Starting with its warranty, we think this is a great offer from the manufacturers for the cost and size of this smoker.

It comes with a thermal sensor which constantly monitors the temperature of the grill while cooking. This makes it a good choice to consider when managing temperatures lowering stress while maintaining the right temperatures.

Consider this machine as an ultimate choice for a tailgating party because of its lightweight and its easily movable features. It has two foldable legs that allow you to stand it on any flat surface. You can also fold the handles as well.

However, you may need to deal with a lot of bending downs as the legs of this machine may be too short for a standard one.

This high-end pellet smoker is WIFI enabled which allows you to control temperatures easily while away from the smoker. This is one of the only smokers on the market to offer this option.

It also comes with a meat probe connected to the temperature controller that allows you to check on the doneness of the food just by fixing the probe through an access hole to the meat.

This is a really cool recommendation for a group of 4 to 6 people and very cost effective on fuel because of the type of pellet it uses. If you are into solar power, this smoker has a 12 Volt jumper cable on a 110 Volt converter. Starting up your device is made easier with this option.
With its versatility, you can grill a pork shoulder, bake a pie, BBQ a chicken, and sear whatever meat you like.

<h2>What is the best pellet smoker/ grill for us?</h2>
On this round of smokers, we are drawn towards technology being one of the things to have on a pellet smoker. The question is, what is the best pellet smoker?

Our best choice will be the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5YFF7W?tag=brobbq-pellet-smoker-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>Green Mountain Davy Crockett Pellet Grill</strong></a>.

<h2>Features to look out for when purchasing the best pellet smoker/grill<img class=""alignright wp-image-3454"" title=""best pellet smoker"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/23.-best-pellet-smoker.jpg"" alt=""best pellet smoker"" width=""300"" height=""612"" /></h2>
<h3>They are heavily flavor driven</h3>
Pellet smokers are a unique type of smoker which generates quality smoky flavors rather than the acrid smoke produced from smoking or grilling on straight fire.
This is why you should purchase the best value smoker to highlight the flavors of your food.
<h3>Easy and convenient use</h3>
Pellet smokers are known not only for their versatility but also for their quick and easy to use instructions.

They are easy to assemble, easy to light up, easy to control temperature with and easy to clean. You will realize that soon enough, grilling at home will be a lovely tradition that the whole family will love to partake in because of the simplicity of its use.
<h3>Go for good pricing</h3>
You don’t have to break the bank when purchasing one of these high-end smokers.
There are plenty of options on the market that offer you the best value for your budget. Taking your needs into consideration, you will be able to cross check from the list below and make a great purchase for the money.

For what it is worth, please take the time to do the research when looking for the best wood pellet smoker. Don’t let time get the best of you and rush you into making a silly decision.
<h3>Great quality build is the best</h3>
The best material to look for would be stainless steel and porcelain coats. They are very long lasting materials and have the ability to withstand the test of time and rust from weather changes.

You should also consider other features that come with the smoker. Ensure that it’s fire pit, grates, vents and flame deflector drip pan are built with stainless steel. These features tend to do most of the heavy duty stuff, so you want to ensure that they will last for a lifetime.
<h3>Consider food output</h3>
When looking for a high-end pellet smoker, consider how much food you will be preparing regularly. If you are just planning to cook for you and your family then you may not need a large pellet smoker. A small or portable pellet grill will suffice your needs.

If you plan on cooking for large amounts of people or hosting large events and parties then you may want to consider buying a larger unit. There are several on the market available to you so make sure and know what your serving size needs will be.
<h3>Take note of temperature control</h3>
Always look out for a pellet smoker that has a temperature algorithm that is able to hold a constant temperature despite the condition of the weather at hand.

Most pellet grills are designed with antiquated timing sequences to stabilize the cooking temperature within the smoker. No need to worry with controlling temperatures using the dampers or vents as this is already almost sorted.
<h3>Minimise the burning of fuel</h3>
First of all, burning fuel is not a very eco-friendly practice, so let’s try to avoid this as much as possible. Thanks to the less-fuel-burn technology equipped with pellet smokers, you will not need to use nearly as much fuel as you would think.

With that being said, purchase a pellet grill that will be very fuel efficient when cooking.

You can save that extra money on some more burgers!
<h3>The hopper size is key</h3>
Look for a sizeable hopper when making a purchase. This advice will come in handy especially for when you have to cook overnight.

It is specifically designed to hold as much heat as possible within the smoker to prevent the use of extra fuel, and constant checks of temperature. This automatically yields good results and is what everybody wants. Gauge for a size of about 40 pounds to keep you in a good target zone.
<h3>Check for warranty</h3>
Make sure to always check to make sure the warranty will either outweigh the price or the decision you are making. Make sure to research this and make sure that the unit you purchase comes with a great warranty.

It does not make sense to buy a product without a warranty.  And if a pellet smoker is not what you’re looking for, you might want to read <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-smoker-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this article</a> to know about other types smokers to use.","7 Best Pellet Smoker Grills For The Money In %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"

<h2>What then qualifies a smoker to be great for a beginner?</h2>
<h3>They are easy and convenient</h3>
One thing is for sure, if they are meant to be for entry level use, then they should be by all means easy and convenient to use. Read as much as you can about them, if there are any contrary talks against this feature, you are free to ignore it.
<h3>They are less costive</h3>
These smokers are meant to help you learn how to smoke, so they definitely should be low in cost so that you can purchase them and practice with them.

How are you sure that smoking is an activity that you will like except you try it? So, why not try it on a smoker with a very low cost and build your way up into more advanced, pricier versions as you master the art.

Hence said, if an entry level smoker is going for a ton, please do not consider it.
<h3>Source of heat</h3>
This is a very important point. All BBQ smokers have different power up sources, so you should look for one that works well for the kind of power that works for you.

It is usually better to use a propane or electric smoker as most entry level users already have some experience using gas or electric cookers, making this type of smokers’ use easier.

Firing up, managing heat and temperatures with electric and propane smokers are much easier than a charcoal or pellet smoker. However, the charcoal and pellet smokers are quick to light up with one try or two, and you’re good.

What is most important is the availability of fuel type in your location, so you can make a choice that fits it.
<h3>Enjoy versatile cooking</h3>
Simply because you are new to smoking does not mean you should be stuck to only grilling chicken breasts.

Learning is a progressive act and so you should be able to explore the various options for this kind of cooking especially in your early days. Then, when you are a pro you can do the harder stuff.

So with this said, go for a starter smoker grill that offers the opportunity to grill, smoke, braise, bbq, sear etc with it. The combination of choice is up to you. In all you do, don’t get stuck to a singular use.
<h3>Be sure it is of a great build</h3>
It is probably your first time going to buy a smoker, you don’t want to be shabby about your purchase because you are just trying it out?

Look out for a great build, stainless steel, cast iron, porcelain coated qualities. These materials are known to last for a long time so you can expect to use the smoker for a great while.

As a beginner, there will be a number of mistakes that may be committed, make sure the smoker you are considering getting is friendly enough to allow you explore your best self without getting ruined.
<h3>How big is it?</h3>
Do you have to break a wall to create space for your smoker? Of course not!

Always go for an option that is small enough to fit in any space. Vertical smokers are usually the best with regards to space saving. They are able to fit well on a balcony and some are even designed to be for a table top. That cute!

Do not be fancily driven by the beast like looking smokers already, take a breather and get something smaller in size for the meantime as you grow in grilling skills, the larger types will fit into your needs just well.
<h3>It should then be portable</h3>
As a build up from the previous point, if the smoker is of good size for you, you can now check for its portability.

For its size, you should be able to move it around easily. Considering that a college student may be using this, you definitely know that your apartment’s space is small and there will be a need to move the smoker around a bit. Don’t go for something that you can’t move around by yourself. It will be a waste of time.

Camping and tailgating parties may be common to you at this point in your life, as you will be highly blooded to show of your skills. Again, you will need to carry your smoker around for these gathering. Ensure that the weight is light enough for you to carry all by yourself.
<h3>Controlling temperature should be easy</h3>
Temperature control is key when using any smoker. More advanced smokers may be more complicating to control temperatures with, so you don’t want to indulge yourself in this stress.

Buy a smoker that offers you easiness to control temperature with.

Look out for what the temperature gauge offers and be sure it fits your needs.
Another tip may be to find a friendly useful thermometer to add as a support for when things seem tough on the smoker. You will be in good place knowing that your food will turn out great at the end.
<h3>What is the rack offering?</h3>
Do you want to cook for just yourself or do you want to share with others?

Factor your answer into purchasing a smoker of this calibre. We said earlier to go for small enough sizes but this does not mean that should be making 1 sausage at a time. That’s cruelty!

Your beginner smoker should be able to feed at least 4 people at a go, so this can be a good standard to use when making your buy.

Classic Pit Barrel Cooker Package 18.5 in"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>In our series of smokers, you will realise that this Pit Barrel smokers has been one of our all time favorite, and in this list, it makes itself as one of the best types of smokers for beginners out there.

It is a simple barrel with 2 hanging rods and 8 stainless steel hooks that allows the user to hang meat or food, and leave it to cook.

It is a typical “set it and leave it” kind of a smoker, so as a beginner you have no business worrying about continually adjusting anything to get the food to cook well.

It is averagely priced and with a little saving here and there, you should be able to buy one at ease.

This Pit Barrel cooker actually offers more than just for a beginner, but is designed to be very easily used by anyone making it one of our choicest.

It is solidly built making it one of the most loved smokers on the market today. A simple 30 gallon porcelain coated steel drum that has been proven to stay in good shape for many years.

This is one that you want to get for your college school days and still keep using for when you start a family, and it will serve you well with no problems.

It has a standard grill grate which gives you a combined option with the hooks to make food for 12 and above people in one turn. This may be a challenging feature as the grill grates may not be enough for diverse cooking, but we believe the the food results yielded covers for this shortfall.

It is a very easy to use charcoal smoker and portable to move around to just anywhere that you will like it to be. It is a vertical smoker, so from our introduction, this serves a great purpose on space.

Camp Chef Smoker 24in ​Smoke Vault ​Extra Large SMV24​"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Words are not enough to describe the unique design of this smoker, it looks just exactly like a vault. So, you know what, you have got treasure in store for you with this one.

It may be complained to be heavy, but this is simply as a result of its build with heavy-gauge steel designed to be as solid as a vault. It sits two cooking grids, one jerky smoky rack, two adjustable smoking racks and a porcelain coated removable base.

From this you are in a good place to make so much food for a medium sized party. Fire up this smoker with a matchless snap - ignition, and be good to make your cooking dreams come true.

Then, the beauty of this vertical vault is its amazing space saving design that still offers 903 square inches in cooking area, meaning, the design of this baby was well thought of. Although, one disadvantage is the lack of its heat holding build which will have made it just perfect.

It has 3 adjustable damper valves which gives you many options to control airflow into the smoker, and then the temperature can be monitored with the door thermometer attached to it. Life made easy!

Now, on saving the best for the last, this is the only smoker in this series and many others out there that offers the user an excellent set of recipes, cooking tips and ideas making it an excellent meat smoker to purchase.

Now, for a beginner, this added feature will come in handy to help glide your way through grilling to becoming a chef of your own standards.

Weber 741001 Original Kettle 22-Inch Charcoal Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Are you on a super tight budget? This smoker is the one for you priced under $100.

This kettle style is a charcoal smoker built with plated steel and enameled with porcelain on the bowl and lid. The grates are plated steel made, so rust is likely not to be a problem with it. Its temperature vents are designed to be rust - resistant and the handles are made with glass reinforced nylon.

We think the material build on this is a good one, however, for the fact that it is not completely done with stainless steel, we will advise that a cover be bought for it to give it a longer life span.

It is a very good heat resistant smoker with the ability to lock in a good amount of heat within the smoker while you cook. Hence, you do not have to worry about constantly checking your fire to ensure that you have this aspect covered.

Cleaning is made easy with its ash cleanout system that has an aluminum ash catcher. Ash is collected into an ashtray that can be easily removed and cleaned after smoking. If you hate the after clean ups, this will work for you.

Masterbuilt 20070910 30-Inch Black Electric Digital Smoker"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This is one of the best vertical electric smokers for beginners covering the needs of space and power availability which is great for a new user. A quick advice; while positioning the smoker ensure to not keep this in the way due to its sharper edges that could create body scratches. This should not scare you however.

It has a feature for managing temperatures which is a very key part to smoking that you should take note of. It is made with digital temperature and timer controls with a digital panel and RF remote control which allows you control temperature easily from a distance.

This makes its use as simple as possible. To top on temperature control is the top air damper attached to the smoker which is to aid with managing temperatures more easily.

It is averagely priced as an under $200 which is a good amount for its digital features.

Cooking space is massive with this one allowing the user to make food for not less than 14 people in one turn. It makes available 4 chrome-coated racks for this purpose that give out a beautiful design on your food for that attraction that you will love.

Keeping your smoky flavors locked in is provided for, with its side loading wood chips compartment. As you grill food, you will come to the realisation that smoky flavors are the magic to winning the love of your friends over.

Finally, beneath the racks is a removable dripping pan to aid with an easy clean up. Grease from the food drips into the pan, and after cooking, all you need to do is to remove the pan and do a few wipes here and there. Your smoker should be as good as sparkling afterwards.

<h2>
		<strong>A further step into </strong>Learning about Barbecue
	</h2>
	<p>First of all, for the purpose of understanding, barbecue is widely initialised as BBQ, so do not be confused at the swap in words in this guide.</p>
<h3>
		Explaining BBQ further
	</h3>
	<p>Going straight up, barbecue is simply a form of cooking where pieces of food; meat, fish, vegetables etc are cooked with close contact to heat without the use of a pan or cooking utensil of some sort.</p>
<p>Unlike cooking with a stove stop, in an instant pot, sous vide etc where the food is placed in a pot, pan, water etc, and cooked with the heat that is derived from the utensil, BBQ allows the food to work directly with the heat with a technique to it. We have explained the technique below.</p>
<p>Barbecuing food, henceforth, yields an amazing feel and taste of food that is very different from the everyday meals we have. It results in foods that are very juicy within, but at the same time crispy with beauty on the outside.</p>
<p>This tells you that, there has got to be an amazing technique to this act. Yes, there is! We will tell you more.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Explain-BBQ-Further.png"" alt=""Explain BBQ Further"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Explain BBQ Further""  />
<h3>
		The most important equipment required to use
	</h3>

	<p>To BBQ, the only equipment that allows for this form of cooking is a grill often termed smokers too, and they come in different types, different power sources, different purposes, and different designs.</p>
<p>They are designed mostly to have a firebox where the fire resides, grill grates and other added features as per the design and purpose of the grill. You can also find them in many stores or search for them online and make a purchase if you do not have one.</p>
<p>Entry level users may often use gas grills because they are simpler to use, hence if you are a beginner at BBQing, you may consider reading our article on <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-a-gas-grill/"" target=""_blank"">how to use a gas grill</a> and <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-smoker/"" target=""_blank"">how to use a smoker</a> to aid you in maximizing your output.</p>
<h3>
		About the two types of heat
	</h3>
	<p>On heat, BBQing food is done by low and slow cooking and then searing.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Low-and-Slow-Cooking.png"" alt=""Low and Slow Cooking"" itemprop=""image"" height=""180"" width=""180"" title=""Low and Slow Cooking""  />
<h4>
		<b>Low and Slow Cooking</b>
	</h4>
	<p>This method is attributed to the term indirect heat where the food is cooked with very little or no closeness to the fire, but the heat generated from the fire does most of the work.</p>
<p>It aims at cooking the food in a slow mode gradually softening the food and allowing the juices within the food to cook it. So in the end, you will have a well-cooked food but very juicy within.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Searing.png"" alt=""Searing"" itemprop=""image"" height=""180"" width=""180"" title=""Searing""  />
<h4>
		<b>Searing</b>
	</h4>
	<p>Afterward, this option comes in to give the food the crispy feel where the food is placed directly over the fire and quickly cooked to brown the outer parts of the foods. It is a very short process, usually ranging from 1 to about 6 minutes per piece.</p>
<p>The goal is not to cook the food with the searing method. It's only to help give it some color and pretty presentation, hence the finishing method for the cook.</p>
	<p><b>*Quick tip:</b> Baking is not barbecuing, it almost feels like we can hear someone asking. Although both options cook somewhat with closeness to fire, baking is a faster method of cooking and the food is mostly done in a baking pan or bowl in few minutes. While barbecuing will go for hours without the use of a utensil.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dig into the various steps on how to barbecue and we believe that this will be your favorite thing soon.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/You-will-need-a-smoker-grill-or-a-combo-both.png"" alt=""You will need a smoker, grill or a combo both"" itemprop=""image"" title=""You will need a smoker, grill or a combo both""  />
<h2>

<h2>
		<strong>Step 2 </strong>Assemble, Clean up and Prepare your Grill
	</h2>
	<p>Once you have this device at hand, assemble it with the manufacturer’s guide, and get it ready to be used.</p>
	<p>Assembling a grill is usually not a daunting task as may be expected, but with an assisting hand you will be able to get it up and standing more easily. Find help, maybe your brother, a friendly neighbour etc, read through the manual carefully (not in a rush), and put the parts together to make one great stand.</p>
<p>You may want to power up the grill immediately you assemble to ensure that it is working properly. It is better to report a fault quickly to the manufacturer’s than wait for later.</p>
<p>On cleaning your grill, if you have had it tucked up for a while these 5 simple steps will help you get out all the insects and germs quickly for a safe barbecue:</p>
	<p><strong>1.</strong> Get in hand some latex gloves, metal wire sponge, and some coarse brush</p>
	<p><strong>2.</strong> Heat up your grill, close the hood and let it heat for about 15 minutes. This step will melt off any hardened grease and will kill any insects hiding in corners.</p>
	<p><strong>3.</strong> After heating, allow the grill to cool down and then remove the grill grates and soak them in soapy water for about 20 minutes. Put on the gloves, and use the metal wired sponge or brush to scrub of food residue and every unwanted item from the grates. Perform this task twice.</p>
	<p><strong>4.</strong> Next clean the lid with some dishwashing soap, as well as the grill tray.</p>
	<p><strong>5.</strong> Finally, do a dry clean wipe with a wet napkin and oil your grill with vegetable oil to avoid rusts.</p>
	<p>You are good to get cooking!!</p>

<h2>
		<strong>Step 3 </strong>Prepare your Fuel
	</h2>
	<p>Based on the type of barbecue equipment that you are using, power sourcing happened in various ways, but one thing is common to all which is using wood chips.</p>
<h3>
		Make a good choice of the most suitable wood chips
	</h3>
	<p>Wood chips are flavoring elements made out of wood to be used in creating smoky flavors while cooking. They are usually safe to use and should not be substituted for work woods which may have chemicals used to treat them that may ruin the flavor and healthiness of your food when used.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Make-a-good-choice-of-the-most-suitable-wood-chips.png"" alt=""Make a good choice of the most suitable wood chips"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Make a good choice of the most suitable wood chips""  />
<h3>
		Selecting the best wood chips that will give you the best flavors
	</h3>
	<p>Wood chips come in various flavors like pecan, hickory, apple, oak, mesquite, maple, alder and many more, and these can be purchased at any barbecue accessory store. You have the liberty to choose your kind of flavor for your food. Use this guide to aid you.</p>
<p>Choosing the right wood chips for the right flavors is totally dependent to you and the good thing is that, most wood chips can go with any kind of meat, fish, and seafood.</p>
<p>You can seek help from the store helper if you have any questions on the exact that one that you hope to use or talk to him or her about your recipe so they advise you on the best wood chips to get.</p>
<h3>
		Prep up the wood chips
	</h3>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Wood-chips-e1526456035256.png"" alt=""Wood chips"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Wood chips""  />
	<p>After getting your wood chips, soak them in water for about 15 minutes before you start cooking, discard the water and place them aside to be used throughout the process of barbecuing.</p>
<p>The exception to this act is for offset smokers which uses only dry wood chips for flavoring. So, take note to use dry wood chips if you are using an offset smoker.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Get-your-food-ready.png"" alt=""Get your food ready"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Get your food ready""  />
<h2>
		<strong>Step 4 </strong>Get your Food Ready
	</h2>
<h3>
		Choose your food
	</h3>
	<p>The real deal is near and your food is the main item of attention. Pick your choice of food, meat, chicken, fish or vegetables and get ready to BBQ.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choose-your-food.png"" alt=""Choose your food"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Choose your food""  />
	<p>Always go for thicker cuts of meat or fish that will not flake easily when barbecuing. This is because these kinds hold up together well and will not break apart when cooking with the type of heat involved.</p>
<p>Vegetables are usually fine, however, do not go for wobbly veggies. Use firm veggies for BBQs.</p>
<h3>
		Know about spicing
	</h3>
	<p>It is important to note that when spicing up your food, it is best to be minimal with the number of spices used. The best basics are usually salt and pepper, and then maybe a dry rub.</p>
<p>Dry rubs are a combination of various spices like cayenne, salt, pepper, powdered garlic, powdered onion, paprika etc. They come in various combinations and it is totally up to you to choose the most ideal rub that will suit your needs.</p>
<p>For a barbecue beginner, it will be best to start with just salt and pepper.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/salt-and-pepper.png"" alt=""salt and pepper"" itemprop=""image"" title=""salt and pepper""  />
<h3>
		Spice up your food
	</h3>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/salt.png"" alt=""salt"" itemprop=""image"" height=""512"" width=""512"" title=""salt""  />
	<p>Now, take your meat, for example, and sprinkle the choice of spice on both sides of it. Rub the spice in and place it aside for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Next, wrap it up in cling film and refrigerate it to marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes. The deeper the marination, the more tasty the food will be.</p>
<p>Do not marinate for too long a time though, otherwise you will alter the texture of the meat which may yield to bad results. The maximum time to marinate is overnight.</p>

<h2>
		<strong>Step 5 </strong>Start Up Your Grill
	</h2>
	<p>The time is up to get your beast up and running.</p>
<h3>
		Preheat the grill for booming temperatures
	</h3>
	<p>This means simply heating up your grill for a while before actually barbecuing.</p>
<p>Light up the fire and close the hood for about 20 minutes to get heated to about 400 oF.</p>
<p>Each type requires a different style of lighting, so please use the manufacturer’s guide attached to the device to aid you with it.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fire.png"" alt=""Fire"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Fire""  />
<h3>
		Benefits for preheating a the grill
	</h3>
	<p>Two important consequences occur when preheating takes place.</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> the machine gets decontaminated of any harmful germs or insects before the food is placed on it.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> the food needs to start cooking in a heated environment, hence preheating prepares the grill to be in a good environment to introduce the food.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Make-a-good-choice-of-the-most-suitable-wood-chipsss.png"" alt=""Make a good choice of the most suitable wood chipsss"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Make a good choice of the most suitable wood chipsss""  />
<h2>
		<strong>Step 6 </strong>Flavoring Up Preps
	</h2>
<h3>
		Adding wood chips
	</h3>
	<p>Now, that your device has heated up, you can now add the wood chips to the top of the charcoal in the fire box if you are using a charcoal smoker.</p>
<p>Otherwise, fill the wood chip loader or compartment with the wood chips in case you are using a propane, pellet or electric smoker. Add dry wood chips to the fire if you are using an offset smoker.</p>
<h3>
		Introducing the water pan
	</h3>
	<p>Next important point is the use of water while cooking to create moisture for the food and to aid in regulating the cooking temperature.</p>
<p>Most grills usually have a water pan for this purpose and all you need to do is to fill it with water, add a few herbs to it (optional) and place the pan under the grill grate exactly below where the food will be. If it does not have its own water pan, you can use an aluminum foil bowl with good size to fit beneath the grill grate.</p>
<p>This method creates amazing moisture for the food so you do not end up having dry meat or flaking fish. Also, the herbs dropped in it increases flavoring that will circulate in the grill.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Its-cooking-Time.png"" alt=""Its cooking Time"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Its cooking Time""  />
<h2>
		<strong>Step 7 </strong>It’s Cooking Time!
	</h2>
	<p>All is set now to get your food on to start barbecuing. Remember the initial step is to cook the food in low indirect heat for a long period of time.</p>
<p>This makes barbecuing or grilling very different from smoking. BBQing takes an hour to about 4 hours usually of slow cooking on low to medium heat to get your food in good taste.</p>
<p>However, smoking is a matter of days affair and requires some great level of patience to make the food. So for this case, we refer to the grilling to achieve amazing barbecues.</p>
	<p>Let’s continue! Place your food on the grill grate directly above the water pan and set the temperature (look out for the thermometer on the smoker) to be between 200 °F to 250 °F and then close the hood.</p>
<p>Now, cook your food for between 1 hour to 4 hours based on the type of food you are cooking without any interruptions.</p>
<p>Take a look at the temperature guide below to aid you in determining the perfect temperatures for a good cook.</p>

<h2>
		<strong>Step 8 </strong>Make Good Use of Cooking Tools
	</h2>
	<p>The process of BBQing could be a risky activity because of the level of heat involved.</p>
	<p>Hence, make good use of tongs, spice brushes, gloves, meat thermometers, knives, plates etc while in the process of cooking. Look through our list of <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-bbq-grill-accessories/"" target=""_blank"">best grill accessories</a> to aid you in choosing or purchasing the right tools for the job.</p>
<p>This will prevent burn from direct body access to the hot grill. Safety is key, aim for this when you cook.</p>

<h2>
		<strong>Step 9: </strong>Temperatures Take Charge of Telling the Doneness
	</h2>
	<p>All grills come with in built thermometers that reads the state of temperature in the grill at a time.</p>
<p>We will advise you to purchase an <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-digital-meat-thermometer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">added food thermometer</a> to help you check the doneness of the food. The tip of the thermometer will be inserted in the food after the timer is over and it is will tell the levels of doneness that the food as reached.</p>

	<p> <b>1.</b> Use this <a href=""https://brobbq.com/Smoking-Times-Temperatures-chart/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">time and temperature chart</a> to aid you in checking on the foods doneness</p>
<p> <b>2.</b> Adjust temperatures, heat and smoke using the vents, dampers and chimneys found on the grill. Look at the previous how-to-guides for assistance on using these features</p>

		<strong>Step 10: </strong>The food is ready
	</h2>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Using-sugar-based-sauce-e1526308510939.png"" alt=""Using sugar based sauce"" itemprop=""image"" height=""100"" width=""100"" title=""Using sugar based sauce""  />
<h3>
		1. Using sugar based sauces
	</h3>
	<p>You may want to coat your food with some sugar based sauces like the common barbecue sauce, which is totally fine to do.</p>
<p>However, because these sauces burn fast, it is best to apply them at the very end of the cook. They will only need to cook for a few seconds and then they should be fine to have.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Perform-the-carryover-cooking.png"" alt=""Perform the carryover cooking"" itemprop=""image"" height=""100"" width=""100"" title=""Perform the carryover cooking""  />
<h3>
		2. Perform the carryover cooking
	</h3>
	<p>The carryover method simply means removing your food from the grill about 15 minutes to its estimated doneness time.</p>
<p>It is scientifically proven that food still cooks up to about 10 minutes after it has being left off the fire. So, to avoid an over cook, calculate your timing well to be able to perform this act.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rest-food-before-enjoying-e1526308708566.png"" alt=""Rest food before enjoying"" itemprop=""image"" height=""100"" width=""100"" title=""Rest food before enjoying""  />
<h3>
		3. Rest food before enjoying
	</h3>
	<p>We know you are eager to gulp your food in already, but it is better to have it sit on a flat surface or plate for about 5 minutes before you slice it up and serve.</p>
<p>This is because it may be too hot to enjoy already, and at the same time you want the juices to settle in well for better enjoyment.</p>
				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Clean-while-warm.png"" alt=""Clean while warm"" itemprop=""image"" title=""Clean while warm""  />

		<strong>Step 11: </strong>Clean while warm

				<img src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Clean-while-Warm.png"" alt=""Clean while Warm"" itemprop=""image"" height=""400"" width=""400"" title=""Clean while Warm""  />
	<p>While you wait for your food to finally cook from the carryover cooking technique, this is a good time to clean your BBQ device while it is still warm. Warm cleaning is the easiest as grease and juices are still in their liquid states at this point, so you can easily sponge and wipe them off.</p>
<p>Some vertical grills include a dripping pan which usually sits beneath the grates for trapping the grease and juices that fall of the food while cooking. This is a great feature for an easy clean, you can take advantage of this style if you hate cleaning.</p>

<h2>
		<strong>Tips and Tricks </strong>For Organizing the Most Amazing BBQs
	</h2>
<h3>
		A clean grill will lead to clean food
	</h3>
	<p>Do not assume that just because you are cooking with heat, your grill will automatically be clean, hence room for laziness.</p>
<p>No no no! For every good food, the work place and place of cooking ought to be clean and free from germs. You will not be guaranteed of healthy and tasty food if you skip this step.</p>
<p>So, take a moment, clean up and oil your grill well before you start cooking. We shared some tips above to aid you with some good cleaning.</p>
<h3>
		Be fun about your barbecue with some themes
	</h3>
	<p>Create some themes for the reason why you woke up to get a barbecue up and running. Friends and loved ones actually do not get excited about coming to just eat food, the real excitement is the reason and the positive feel to be derived from the meet up.</p>
<p>So, think through some amazing theme ideas like a bonfire night barbecue, a Cuban themed barbecue etc to spark up the excitement at the party. Work with some amazing and matching colors to drive up everyone’s adrenaline. Plan well ahead to have a good set up on the day.</p>
<h3>
		Making a menu is as important as the food itself
	</h3>
	<p>You cannot just cook anything for everyone and expect to get everyone excited.</p>
<p>Take a day or 2, sometimes a week and draw out an exciting menu for the number of people that you are hoping to serve. Look through recipes online, cookbooks and ask family or friends for ideas to help you in creating a fantastic menu.</p>
<p>Make options that fit various dietary needs so you do not have half of your guest happy and the other half regretful. Make sure to include some drinks, accompaniments and sauces to go with your BBQ.</p>
<h3>
		Make provision for good music
	</h3>
	<p>There is something about having good music playing in the background while you party with your friends. Do not ignore this aspect. Choose a selection that boosts parties and get your speakers and player ready for this.</p>
<p>Do not go with loud music, be considerate with the volume. The focus is to have something playing the background, and not an overpowering noisy sound. You might be busy handling food or guests on the day, simply assign this role to someone else.</p>
<h3>
		Prep up your food and set up the night before
	</h3>
	<p>The barbecue day is going to be a fun but overwhelming day, so you want to make enough time to be able to cover everything. Prep your foods and drinks the night before. Tuck them in the refrigerator for the next day.</p>
<p>You should also arrange table, chairs, canopies etc the night before so that the next day, all you will have to do will be to wipe away dust from the chairs and tables. This will take no time to do.</p>
<p>You can get the kids involved in this process, if you have some. They will love to help!</p>
<h3>
		Make provision for entertainment activities
	</h3>
	<p>A BBQ party is not all about eating, it is a moment when loved ones come together to share happy times over great food. So, to boost this happy time, you will need some entertaining activities like games, riddles etc to get everyone engaged in the party.</p>
<p>A good way to not spend extra money on getting some entertainment items can be to ask your guest to come along with some games and extras. This way you can have your mind focused on the food and the management of the party.</p>
<h3>
		Don’t open the hood or door when cooking
	</h3>
	<p>Simple, do not do this! Do not interrupt the cooking process for at least the next 1 hour 30 minutes, otherwise, you will let out a good amount of heat and your food’s proper doneness will be interrupted.</p>
<p>You may end up with bad food after all the stress of cooking.</p>
<h3>
		Make provision to distract kids from disturbing
	</h3>
	<p>As part of your entertainment preps, plan some good activities for kids to get them not to disturb the adults while the party is in progress. Kids are drawn to kids. Create a designated and safe playing area for them to play games, run around freely and just do what they love to do, PLAY!</p>
<p>You can also have a designated eating area for older children, about 4 years and above, to eat when it’s time for the food. Meanwhile, you and the adults around will have to keep a constant eye on them because as you know, kids can be overly explorative.</p>
<h3>
		Get help through and through
	</h3>
	<p>Organising a BBQ can be very tiring and time consuming, so we urge that you do not this all by yourself. Ask for help from friends, loved ones etc so that you are not all by yourself on this project.</p>
<p>You can designate various aspects to different people like music handling, emceeing, handling kids, cleaning up afterwards etc. This will give you a lot of control over the party as you are the overall manager of the success of it.</p>
<h3>
		Make sure to have fun by all means
	</h3>
	<p>Many at times, the organizer of the party usually finds himself or herself drained through the process and misses out on the fun part.</p>
<p>Avoid this for this was not why you planned the party in the first place. Follow the above tips and make sure that once the party starts, you are very involved in the fun that is shared. Have someone help out with the food if you will be stressed handling it, and have fun!!</p>
<p>On the other hand, everyone came for the party because of you so you ought to be that power booster in the center cheering everyone on. You can only do this by having fun yourself.</p>

Masterbuilt 20070910 30-Inch Black Electric Digital Smoker"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Four things that make this smoker a good choice for the price: accurate temperature control, good material build, added features and good heat holder.

These features are the basics of all that you need in an electric smoker. Most electric smokers may not have certain added features like a side loading wood chip compartment to give off smoky flavors to your food while it cooks. For this reason, this smoker has a good mark to it for this addition.

It also comes with a drip pan to aide the user in an easy cleanup after cooking. While cooking, juices and grease drop into this dripping pan which the user will only have to remove and clean.

Temperature like we said earlier is key to smoking and this smoker is made with a thermostat digital temperature and timer control which can be easily managed by an added remote control.

This means you will not necessarily have to change the degrees on the smoker exactly. You can always do this if you are a short distance away from the smoker. This is however, not a reason to ignore your food, you may run into trouble.

It has 4 chrome made racks and cooking area of 730 sq inches which is ideal to make food for 14 people. A very affordable purchase can still be beneficial in food production numbers.

Finally, this smoker holds a good amount of heat while cooking and offers the option to set your ideal cooking temperature and timer, leave it and when the timer is done, it will automatically shut off.

<h2>Our best choice from the list</h2>
All the smokers here have amazing features, but our most loved has almost all the different qualities, but with the highest cooking area.

Hence, the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00104WRCY?tag=brobbq-electric-smoker-200-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>Masterbuilt 20070910 30-Inch Black Electric Digital Smoker, Top Controller</strong></a> is our top best.

It offers 730 square inches of cooking space for its price which is ideal for a group of more than 10 people.

The Masterbuilt brand has long been known for good results, and this model attests to that fact.

It has a wood chip pan for that very important smoke flavor, a water pan to create the moisture that you need and a removable drip pan to help you clean the mess easily after cooking.

<h2>Low price doesn’t mean inferiority; look out for these qualities</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3540"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/34.-Best-Electric-Smokers-Under-200.jpg"" alt=""Best Electric Smokers Under 200"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />
<h3>Price first</h3>
You want to stick to your budget when scanning through a variety of electrical options. Hence this list of electric smokers to keep you in focus.

It is okay to not want to spend so much on a smoker, so you should have this in mind when making a decision. There are many options on the market that cost below $200 and work perfectly.

On the other hand, many manufacturers have foreseen this need, therefore, making models that fit small budgets, so grab the best for you.
<h3>Aim for durability</h3>
No compromising and lazy buying. A low priced smoker does not mean an inferior one. There are many cheap smokers on the market that are built with great quality so take your time in searching for their quality level.

Look out for materials like heavy duty steel, porcelain, cast iron and stainless steel on both the outer and inner build and you will not be disappointed.
<h3>Consider your space</h3>
Take an extra step to measure up your space so you have a good idea of what size of smoker will fit well in your space.

Otherwise, you may need to create space which will have been totally unnecessary if you had done your homework well.
<h3>Is it complete in parts?</h3>
You have the right to be picky. Scan through as many options as you find ensuring that it includes all the parts that you need and more, and that these parts have great reviews about them.

You will save yourself a ton of money by this simple effort. In the future after, you can change some parts which by then, you will have enough money at hand to do so.
<h3>Electricity is the source here</h3>
This is what we are preaching about here and that should be what you should be looking out for. Electricity is cheap to use, and most electric smokers offer everything a charcoal smoker will offer.

These types of smokers are usually cheaper so it is wise that you place your target on these. On the other hand, you do not get to spend much money on expensive fueling, all you will need to do is to buy flavored wood chips to flavor up your food.

Check to be sure that the smoker is an electric one that needs only electricity to power it up for a great use.
<h3>How often do you want to use it?</h3>
Are you going to be grilling very often or do you need it for that once in a while event when you invite friends over?

If you do not need it for heavy duty cooking, then you do not have to buy a heavy duty smoker which are usually more expensive.

On the other hand, if you will be smoking 4 to 5 times a month, there are also still options that allow you spend less and are durable to handle the workload.
<h3>How good is its temperature control?</h3>
Smoking without the ability to work with temperature is a total waste of time. Make sure the smoker’s temperature controls work very well.

The thermometer, dampers and vents should all be in very good working conditions. This way you will not have to spend extra on a thermometer to be able to read the temperatures in which your food is being cooked in.","5 Best Electric Smokers Under $200 To Buy - %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"

Do not fret over it, we are here to explain to you just how easy it is to do it. After you’ve been through it, you’ll already be armed with your thermometer, meat, and smoker to plan your BBQ.

Smoking (meat and fish and veggies) is another type of cooking involving mainly the process of cooking the food by exposing it to smoke from a burning material, most of the time wood. It can be done in two basic ways, which happens to be Hot Smoking and Cold Smoking. The former is done in temperatures between 100 degrees Fahrenheit to 200 degrees Fahrenheit while the latter is done in temperature less than 100 degrees.

For smoking to be done well, you should have the right supplies and equipment. It could potentially be anything from a hole in the ground to a drum smoker or box smoker and can range from each type of food it can hold.

It is a general advice that to get the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-smoker-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best smoker</a>, you should use only hardwood. These are typically in the form of Oak, Hickory among others. Some smokers can also use pellets, charcoal, and propane. Now without any further ado, let’s take a look at the different types of meat you can smoke and what are the smoking times and temperatures.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Beef smoking times and temperatures</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=36]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Beef Brisket</h3>
Brisket smoking time is usually between 12 – 20 hrs. Being one of the classic barbecue meat, it might pretty stressful to smoke it right but if you just follow the instructions then it will be good. Keep in mind that once the brisket smoking temperature is around 195°F, then the meat is done. A tip for cooking brisket is that the higher the thickness of flat area, the higher should be the temperature but your smoker temperature should be between 225°F - 250°F.

One thing that you should make sure is not to succumb to opening the grill from time to time unless it is for adding wood or the fuel you are using. Now to know exactly if the brisket is done, just stick the tip of a knife into it or even a fork, if it twists easily, then it's done.
<h3>Tips: Back Ribs (Beef)</h3>
Now beef smoking ribs time (back ribs) is always usually around 4 – 6 hrs. To be done rightly, you should probably cut the ribs apart before starting. Also make sure you have either let the ribs thaw if it was frozen or if you have just gone to the butcher, pick those of the pinkest in color since it will cook better.

Your smoker temperature should around 225°F - 250°F and when done, your rib temperature should be around 185°F - 190°F. A tip for you to check the temperature of the meat is to get a meat thermometer.
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Pork smoking times and temperatures</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=37]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Pork shoulder (or Pork Butt)</h3>
Pork shoulder smoking time or Pork Butt smoking time (Pork butt is the upper shoulder) usually takes about 1 hour per pound of meat, so the ideal size being 12 pounds, meaning more or less 12 hours for the meat smoking time. Make sure your pork shoulder is already thawed a few hours before you plan to smoke it. Once you have it, put it onto your table and start by putting your favorite rub all over the piece of meat. We usually recommend BBQ rub but you might choose one of your preference.

Make sure you trim the excess fat of the meat as well. Like most big chunks of meat, it is better to use the low and slow method which like you may have guessed it keeping the smoker temperature around 225 – 250 °F.

Once you have followed all of the above method then, you just need to keep an eye onto your meat thermometer. Once the meat hits around 160 – 165 °F, take it off and wrap it in aluminum foil then put it back until it gets to around 190 – 195 °F.
<h3>Tips: Baby Back Rib</h3>
Baby back rib smoking time usually takes about 5 hours at a temperature of 225 – 250 °F which meat considered done at 180 °F. As a tip the meat of the baby back ribs take an hour extra to get tender and done. Once that is done, you apply your preferred rubbing then put it in your pre-heated smoker. Remember to keep adding wood when necessary and do not open every time just to check if the meat smells good.
<h3>Tips: Pork Sausage</h3>
Pork sausage usually takes about 1-3 hours to smoke at a constant smoker temperature of 225 – 250 °F and 165 °F when done.
You should preheat your smoker for at least one hour before putting your sausages into it. Once the sausages are on, add some wood to get the heat higher and to produce more smoke. Make sure you have your digital meat thermometer next to you as you will need to get your sausage internal temperature up to at least 160°F.

For sausages, there is no need to turn them over, and make sure to put some needle sizes hole to allow the heat to escape so that it does not lose shape.
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Lamb smoking times and temperatures</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=38]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Lamb Leg</h3>
Lamb leg ideally cooks for duration of 4 - 8 hours at smoker temperature of 225 – 250 °F. Until your lamb shows temperature of between 140 – 150 °F which you can check via a meat thermometer, you should not remove it.

You should maintain the smoker temperature in the range above for better results. A tip is to marinade your lamb about 5-10 hours earlier and soak it in a plastic back before the time of smoking it. As usual make sure the meat is thawed before putting it in the smoker or else it might cook only on the surface leaving you with a raw inside.
<h3>Tips: Lamb Shoulder</h3>
Lamb shoulder typically takes 5 - 5.5 hours to cook at smoker temperature 225 – 250 °F with meat done with its temperature showing 170 °F onto your thermometer. Now here are some tips before smoking your first lamb shoulder. If it's your first I would advise you to go with a boneless one since it's easier to cut and shred.

Also before cooking, make sure you trim the excess fat and rub the meat with your favorite mixture or paste. Like all smoked meat, stick your knife into it to see if it’s done and make sure to spray occasionally if it’s not done yet.
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Poultry smoking times and temperatures</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=39]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Whole turkey</h3>
The smoking turkey time is usually around 4 – 5 hours at a constant smoker temperature of 275 – 350 °F and considered to be ready when meat is around 170 °F.

For turkey, you should probably rub the skin with the oil of your choice and add some of your preferred rubbing. Once you're done with that, preheat your smoker to the required temperature and after a while, put your turkey into the smoker. Close the lid and add hardwood pellets when needed.
<h3>Tips: Whole Chicken</h3>
The smoking time of whole chicken is about 2-3 hours since chicken is one of the easiest things to smoke. However like many other types of poultry, it requires to be smoked at a much higher temperature than beef and pork. After all smoking times and temperature varies from meat to meat, and for chicken, the smoker temperature should be maintained around 275 – 350 °F with the internal temperature hitting approximately 170 °F before being considered done.

As with most smoked meat, preparation is key, so make sure you do the rubbing a few hours before smoking it as it will give the chicken meat some color. For chickens apart from the temperature using your thermometer, it is not required to keep checking meat from time to time.
Just make sure there is enough wood and smoke and you should be sorted.
<h3>Tips: Chicken Thighs</h3>
Chicken thighs smoking time is a lot less that most smoking since it’s about 1.5 hours. It is still smoked at a temperature of 275 – 350 °F with the meat temperature considered done at 170 °F which seems to be the benchmark for chicken. We usually go the low and slow process like always to get optimum cooking results.

Why we go low and slow is so that you can get the skin crispy for better enjoyment. If you follow the temperatures and steps above, you should get a tender and juicy meat on bite which is infused with the flavor rubbings of your choice.

You should however check from time to time to prevent it from overcooking. Do make sure that you always have your digital thermometer in hand to know when the meat is done, since you wouldn't want a chewy meat
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Seafood smoking times and temperatures</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=40]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Salmon filet</h3>
Smoking salmon time and temperature should be 1 hour and 220 °F respectively to get the best result out of your Salmon filet.
First of all, you should mix some brine ingredient along with your fish into a plastic container; you can then put it into the refrigerator. Next you have to dry the fish and pat the brine dry.

Once you're done with that, let your fish dry for 2 - 4 hours maximum. Once you are ready, preheat your smoker to the required temperature as stated above and place it inside then close the lid. After one hour in the smoker, you can take the cover off, and spray it into the syrup or paste of your choice for every subsequent hour. Once the required time has passed, you can take your salmon filet off the smoker and enjoy it, preferably with a salad.
<h3>Tips: Whole Trout</h3>
Smoking trout temperature should always be at 225 °F and it should smoke for 1 hour with the fish temperature to reach 145 °F before being considered done. Like salmon, trout should be mixed with brine and kept into a glass or plastic container so as to get ready. Don't put too much of brine though since trout doesn't really need it that much.

The brining can be done with 1 tablespoon of salt or kosher salt for every cup of water.After having let it rest for a few hours, you need to tap the brine out of it dry. A few tips or ideas of seasoning are to add some black pepper, olive oil and garlic if you wish. The most important step to not forget though is to clean the fish before brining.

Trout smoking time though generally 1hr, it can be let to smoke a little more to add some more flavor. You should however watch out so that the fish doesn't dry out, although you can leave them in the smoker for up to 4 hours at the specified temperature.
Since we’re done with a pick out of most time of meat or fish, let’s review some important question
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Vegetable &amp; Miscellaneous</h2>
[supsystic-tables id=41]

&nbsp;
<h3>Tips: Smoked Potatoes</h3>
For potatoes, you can rub them in butter with some generous seasoning (salt and pepper and etc.). When you are ready to smoke them, make sure to toss a few more wood into the smoker. The potatoes should be at the center of it before covering. Potatoes takes about 2 - 3 hours to get smoked at a temperature of 225 – 240 °F. There is no real guide of the potato temperature but make sure you follow the duration of cooking it.
<h3>Tips: Smoked Corn</h3>
For smoked corn, the process is pretty easy. You should place it into a pan or oven equipment and pour some butter or oil all over it. It smoking time is pretty quick being 1.5 – 2 hours at a smoker temperature of 225 – 240 °F. You should not forget to keep adding wood so that the temperature hover between the mentioned one. As a plus, since it does not take lots of space, you can smoke it along with your potatoes. So that's two veggie plates in one cooking.
<h2>How weather affects the smoking time and temperature?</h2>
Smoking done outdoor can have some effects onto the meat. In some cases even if the temperature is set at the desired level, the meat temperature may not rise at all due to the temperature difference of inside and outside.

Most smokers are tested inside when manufactured. A tip to counter it to some extent is to keep a cover or lid to go along with it. Although some temperature might still be saved, it is better than nothing, you don't want to smoke your meat inside for a birthday party or event.
<h2>How to measure the temperature?</h2>
To check the temperature, you should probably have to buy a good digital meat thermometer. The meat thermometer checks the internal temperature of the meat so that to know if it’s cooked or not. It also helps greatly to see if your smoked meat is done or not as without it, you would be left guessing and might ingest overcooked or undercooked meat which might be harmful to your health.
Here you can see the steps needed to check your meat temperature once it’s done.
<h2>What would you need to determine the food is cooked in the right way or not?</h2>
Now back in the time when people wanted to determine if their meat was smoked or not, they would just check the clock or cut a piece of the meat to taste.This can make the whole meat lose some of its flavor. Nowadays, we don't have to do all of that since we have<a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-digital-meat-thermometer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> digital meat thermometers</a> where you just stick it into the meat and it will tell you the exact temperature it is.

From that you will know if it's time to eat it now. Another tip although for pork meat, you just press your finger onto the wrapping, if the meat indents, then you know it is cooked.
<div class=""product-pros"" style=""float: none; width: 100%;"">
<p class=""product-pros-title"">Here are a few tips:</p>

<ul style=""list-style-type: none;"">
 	<li>First of all, I would advise you to follow the times and temperature specified</li>
 	<li>The type of smoker you use might also vary the cooking time</li>
 	<li>Normally it is better to use hardwood, but some people use charcoal as well as some other types of fuel</li>
 	<li>Is the meat boneless (easier to cook) or bone-in?</li>
 	<li>Also the thickness of the meat since some meat cook at a rate of 1 hour per pound</li>
</ul>
</div>
Once you’ve read the smoking times and temperature of all those types of meat, I would advise you to check all the outside conditions that may affect your smoking. Remember smoking times and temperature vary from meat to meat so don’t expect all of them to be the same by cooking at the same time and temperature.
<h2>What to do if the food is overcooked or undercooked?</h2>
Now the most common problem people have is that they are new to smoking and end up overcooking the meat. Then they fret that it's wasted and can't do anything about it. You can though! What you will have to do is to put it back in the smoker and start reheating it back slowly at a lower temperature, this will allow the meat to tenderize again. This can probably only be done once, so do not mess up this time too.

Otherwise, if you cannot do that, you can always shred the meat and use it in traditional dishes or even use it as a base for another dish.
For undercooked meat, make sure you shred it in small places and cook it on double the temperature. Do not eat before you’ve smoked it again since it can be harmful to your health.

Once you’ve found the steps you need to cook your type of food. Then follow the steps and Bon Appétit!",

The build is both simple and sturdy, which makes it a great investment.

The rotating display is another great feature of the model. It’s a two-inch display, it’s easy to read and lights up automatically which is useful in low light environments.

The display on the thermometer rotates automatically, so if you change the angle of the thermometer, the display will rotate to always show right side up. The temperature read times are very short, about three seconds, and it has accuracy within 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Intelligent Stabilization Alert and temperature display hold is a combination that makes the unit one of the best leave in digital meat thermometers out there. Three seconds after inserting the probe in your food, the thermometer will beep, alerting you that the temperature has been read.

The locked in temperature will continue to display on the screen for several seconds. This makes it a good thermometer to use for the oven, as you just need insert the thermometer, wait to hear the beep and then take it out.

You don’t have to hold your hand inside waiting for the readout. While the model is great for checking the temperature on single food items, it won’t give you the reading on your grill temperature, and it cannot be used to display several temperatures at once.

Maverick manufactures the best leave in meat thermometers that consistently get good reviews and are recommended and sought after by amateurs and professionals.

This dual probe meat thermometer lets you simultaneously monitor the meat and the internal pit temperature from up to 300 feet away. The probe wires are three feet long and are rated for a maximum temperature of 716 degrees Fahrenheit.

If you’ve used a wireless smoker thermometer before, especially one with two probes, nothing will surprise about the setup of the unit. It comes with a transmitter that connects to the two probes which are then placed inside your smoker.

You can choose from fifteen presets for different types of meat: beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, deer, elk, moose, buffalo, rabbit, boar, duck, bird and fish. Presets for several degrees of doneness are also offered, but it also comes with manual settings.

Setup is pretty straightforward. You select the probe, then choose what temperature you want.

You can also set a temperature range. An audible alarm sounds when the temperature goes outside a lower or upper limit, and this can be turned off.

The backlight on the receiver goes out after only five seconds. This is long enough for a quick temperature reading, but a little bit annoying if what you’re trying to do is change the settings in the dark.

There is also an alert to let you know if a loss of signal has occurred or if you go out of range. This is another nice feature to have.

We think that the model works best when used in a smoker setup. This is a great meat thermometer for smoker.

<h2>Why a Digital Meat Thermometer is a Must Have?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3650"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/40.-Best-Digital-Meat-Thermometer.jpg"" alt=""Best Digital Meat Thermometer"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />

Those who take their cooking or grilling seriously know that an accurate thermometer is a must have. A digital bbq thermometer is convenient because it’s always ready and it clearly displays the exact temperature reading, usually within two degrees of accuracy.

Whereas traditional analog thermometers may need to be constantly calibrated and it can be hard to tell exactly what temperature they’re showing. Besides, some of them can be up to five degrees off, which in some cases can be enough to make a difference and can result in undercooked or overcooked foods.

The electronic meat thermometers are able to provide accurate temperatures in hot and cold foods and beverages and have a wide temperature range. They’re also easy to store, have user-friendly interfaces, and helpful instruction manuals, which tell you what buttons to press to efficiently operate the thermometer.

As top rated thermometers are very exact and can show the temperature within one degree of accuracy, a bonus feature is the ability to display the exact temperature readout in both degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. This comes in handy if you’re following an international recipe.","5 Best Digital Meat Thermometer: For Smoker & Grill - %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"

The probe wires are rated for temperatures of up to 716 degrees Fahrenheit (380 degrees Celsius).

In this top rated wireless thermometer, you will find all of the features you would expect to find in a professional kitchen gadget. It has a large and simple LCD display that shows just all the important and necessary information.

With the twin probe design, the thermometer can be used to read the temperature of the food as well as the oven, grill or smoker. The screen is backlit and it can be used in low light conditions or even night time.

There are preset temperatures for nine different types of meat: ground beef, ground poultry, veal, chicken, pork, beef, poultry, lamb and fish.

The receiver also has alarms, a countdown or count-up timer, and can operate when it is up to 300 feet away from the base. It runs on 4 AAA batteries.

As far as meat thermometers go, this unit is great! It’s difficult to come up with downsides.

Just download the free app and you can monitor your food as long as your phone or tablet up to 170 feet away. You can engage in chores or watch TV without worrying to be constantly coming to the grill or oven to check on your food.

The model comes with six stainless steel probes, so you can monitor several individual pieces of food, and you can monitor your meat and temperature at the same time. That makes it one of the most versatile BBQ thermometers out there.

The temperature readings go from -58 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit.

The thermometer has preset temperatures for eleven types of food including: beef, veal, lamb, chicken, pork, fish, turkey, hamburgers, etc. All of the preset temperatures can be re-programmed to suit your personal taste.

On the down side, the thermometer is not waterproof, so it might get damaged if you leave it sitting outside next to your grill or smoker.

Since phones and tablets are so ubiquitous now and you’re likely to have your phone with you most of the time. We don’t think this is really an issue and you’ll be able to use this bluetooth meat thermometer with no problem.

The range is pretty huge: up to 170 feet. So, you’ll be good to go as long as your device is within that range.

This remote thermometer has four probes to allow you to cook your food accurately by giving you the ability to monitor the temperature of your meat and that of the oven, smoker, or grill. Temperature measurements range from 32 to 572 degrees Fahrenheit.

The wire is made with metal braiding and upgraded Teflon core capable of withstanding temperatures of up to 716 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are preset temperatures and cooking levels for eleven kinds of food. You can set high and low temperature ranges and set the timer. You can also configure your own settings manually to suit your taste. When the time is up or the temperature has been reached, the thermometer will beep and the LCD will flash to let you know. You’ll never have to worry about overcooking or under-cooking.

The unit also has a magnetic back, making it very convenient especially for grilling. Just attach the thermometer to one of the non-heated grill to make sure it does get in the way.

The free companion app can be downloaded on any mobile device running Android or iOS.

There is a basic LED display that you can use, but to do things remotely, you will need to pair it with your Android or iOS device.

Fortunately, that is easy to do. The thermometer can connect with a tablet, phone, or laptop using Bluetooth and it delivers constant updates.

Instead of having to carry some new gadget around the house, all you need to do is keep your phone handy, which is something you probably already do anyway.

Because of this, the thermometer is very easy to program. This is taken care of through the app’s interface, rather than through a few plastic buttons. The companion app has been designed to be incredibly intuitive and easy to use.

The specifications of this unit are pretty nice. It’s available in both one-probe and two-probe versions. We recommend the two-probe version. It’s not too much more expensive and being able to monitor the temperature of the oven or grill along with the food comes in pretty handy.

The Bluetooth transmitter works up to 300 feet away, while long cords on the temperature probes enable you to place the base fairly far from your oven or BBQ.

Best of all, the brand offers a lifetime limited warranty with every unit sold. They’re pretty confident in the durability of this product, so you don’t have to worry about it breaking or burning out.

As far as downsides go, the temperature probes only go up to about 482 degrees Fahrenheit. Although you certainly don’t want your meat to get anywhere near this hot, it is kind of a limitation on how you can use it to measure your oven or grill temperature.

It’s probably best if you remove the probes from your heating area before you broil or sear anything. But other than that, this digital meat thermometer is pretty great.

It’s perfect if you don’t want to carry around an extra gadget, want a user interface that is easy to use, or even if you just think that using your phone for cooking is kind of cool. It’s probably not for you if you’re into more serious, heavier cooking.

It includes its own receiver.

The probes plug into a transmitter that sends data to the receiver up to 300 feet away.

There are two probes in the box: a short, straight one to measure the barbecue temperature and another one in the shape of an L with a sharp point to be inserted into food. The transmitter has two labeled inputs, one for each probe.

The display has a transmitter that shows the probe temperature in an alternating pattern. Degrees in Fahrenheit or Celsius can be selected on the back of the transmitter.

We found the cables that come with it to be a little short, though.

The display on the receiver works in two modes. In thermometer mode, it displays the temperature of each probe. The food probe can be set to alert you when a certain temperature has been reached. The barbecue probe has an upper and a lower limit that will sound an alarm if the temperature goes outside those limits.

The temperature limits are set through a procedure that requires pressing on the light/mode button to lock them in. If this is not done correctly, the setting will go back to their previous values. We thought this was a little bit confusing.

The barbecue alarm won’t go off until the temperature goes above the lower limit, so you won’t have to listen to beeping while the unit heats up. If the thermometer and the receiver lose communication, there will be an audible and visible alarm to let you know what has happened.

The other mode is the timer mode. You set a time and the timer will count down until it reaches zero, and at this point an alarm will sound and then the time will begin counting upward.

The timer can also act as an up-counter by setting the initial time to zero. The alarm sound for the timer is different from the temperature alarms, and both modes can be used simultaneously.

This remote thermometer is one of the most popular ones in the market, and there is good reason for that. It is well-made, the transmitter is resistant to water, and it’s accurate. If you follow the instructions, it is reasonably easy to use.

When the thermometer is not in use, the probe folds completely inside the body and locks in place by means of a hinged button. Just push the button to unlock the probe again. This helps avoid damaging the probe in between uses.

This model has a wide temperature range of -58 to 572°F (-50 to 300°C), making this a very versatile device. It’s great for indoor or outdoor cooking, grilling or even baking.

The temperature read out has a selector to choose degrees in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

The build is both simple and sturdy, which happens to be one of its best perks.

The rotating display is another great feature of this particular model. It’s a two-inch display and it’s easy to read, lights up automatically and is useful in low light environments. The display on the thermometer rotates automatically, so if you change the angle of the thermometer, the display rotates to always show the right side up. The read times are very short, about three seconds, and it has accuracy within 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Intelligent Stabilization Alert and temperature display hold is a combination that makes the unit one of the best digital thermometers out there. Three seconds after inserting the probe in your food, the thermometer will beep, alerting you that the temperature has been read.

The locked in temperature will continue to display on the screen for several seconds. This makes it easier to check temperatures inside an oven. You just insert the thermometer, wait to hear the beep and take it out.

While the unit is great for checking the temperature on single food items, it won’t give you a reading on your grill temperature and it cannot be used to display several temperatures at once.

It also has a magnet inside so it can easily be attached to the refrigerator when it’s not in use.

The thermometer is waterproof, so you can wash it without having to worry about water getting inside.

The long folding probe is convenient for easily and safely getting the internal temperature of any cooked food. It also works great with deep frying, baking and beverages, like beer, wine, milk water, tea and coffee.

This is probably the best instant read meat thermometer for smoking, too.

The tip of the probe is very thin and has anti-bacterial coating. It will not leave any visible traces on food. When the probe is closed, the thermometer switches off automatically.

However, there is some functional problem with the probe that can often come off the thermometer causing occasional difficulty and interruption.

The body of the thermometer is made of strong ABS plastic, so it’s meant to be durable and withstand a few drops. The probe is made of stainless steel and will not break easily when bent.

Plus, it comes with a lifetime money back guarantee if for any reason you are not satisfied with the product.

<h2>Why Do You Need an Instant Read Thermometer?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3787"" title=""Best Instant Read Thermometer"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/38.-Best-Instant-Read-Thermometer.jpg"" alt=""Best Instant Read Thermometer"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />

Anyone who is serious about cooking, smoking or grilling knows that a thermometer is a must have. So, why is it so necessary? Let’s understand the following factors:
<h3>Convenience</h3>
An instant read digital meat thermometer is so convenient because you don’t have to wait a long time for it to hit its final temperature read and you avoid burning yourself by keeping a safe distance from the heat source.
<h3>Accuracy</h3>
Instant read thermometers provide the accuracy necessary to know when a home-baked loaf of bread or a well-cooked pork roast is done. Traditional analog thermometers may need to be constantly calibrated and it can be hard to tell exactly what temperature they’re reading.

Besides, some of them can be a few degrees off which can be enough to make a difference and can result in undercooked or overcooked foods.
<h2>What to Look for in an Instant Read Thermometer?</h2>
These are what we think are the main features to consider when purchasing the best rated instant read meat thermometer:
<h3>Design</h3>
The most popular design nowadays is one with a hinged, folding probe that has no sleeve. These tend to be more sophisticated.

The other design that can be found is a wand-style probe with a sleeve to protect it.
<h3>Functionalities</h3>
With some thermometers you just stick them in and wait for a read out. Others require that you navigate a small number of buttons that let you change the temperature units, hold the readout or calibrate the temperature.
<h3>Range</h3>
Cooking thermometers should have a temperature range going from below zero to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.
<h3>Speed</h3>
How fast does it read the temperature? That is one of the biggest factors to think about when getting the best quick read thermometer of this type.
<h2>How to use an Instant Read Thermometer?</h2>
It does not matter how accurate or expensive a thermometer is. It will do you no good if you don’t know how to use it.

And by that, we mean you gotta know how to stick it.
<h3>Locating the Cooler Area of the Meat</h3>
With accurate meat thermometers, you don’t necessarily want to hit the very center of the meat. What you want to do is try to find the coolest part of the meat.

You would think that the coolest part is located in the center, but it doesn’t really have to be. Meat has different parts such as connective tissue, fat, muscle, bones and water which are all substances that transfer heat differently.

So just aiming for the exact physical center will not always work.
<h3>Pushing the Thermometer All the Way</h3>
So, don’t worry about hitting the center. Aim for that general area. Rather than trying to guess when you’ve reached the center, push the thermometer all the way through until it comes out on the other side or the meat.

If it’s a whole turkey or a prime rib, push the thermometer probe until it hits the bone.
<h3>Pulling the Thermometer Back</h3>
Once you’ve done that, slowly pull the thermometer back through the meat. As the tip enters the meat, the temperature reading will rise quickly and it will start to drop as you get closer to the center.

Keep slowly pulling the thermometer and you will eventually hit a low point. After that the numbers will start to rise again. The minimum point is the temperature reading you should go by.","5 Best Rated Instant Read Thermometers - %%currentmonth%% %%currentyear%%"
3751,"5 Best Smoker Thermometers In 2018: For Grilling & Smoking","When cooking, thermometers are just as important as any other tool because they help you make sure that your food is safe, tender, juicy, and full of flavor. For the most part, you are not able to rely on the thermometer that’s already built into your smoker. Most manufacturers tend to cut costs in these areas and these thermometers only tell you the temperature of the air within the cooker and not the internal temperature of the food.

Obtaining the best smoker thermometer will help you accurately measure the temperature and really tell when the food is ready to be served. We have reviewed the best BBQ smoker thermometers and created a list of some of the most reliable thermometer models for 2018.

<h2>Reviews of the Best Smoker Thermometers for 2018</h2>
<h3>1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FOCR4UI?tag=brobbq-smoker-thermometer-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Maverick ET-733 Long Range Wireless Dual Probe BBQ Smoker Meat Thermometer</a></h3>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FOCR4UI?tag=brobbq-smoker-thermometer-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img class=""size-full wp-image-3785 alignright"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Maverick-ET-733.jpg"" alt=""Maverick ET-733"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>This one has become one of the most popular and top-rated meat thermometers which come as no surprise.

The brand is known for manufacturing accurate meat BBQ thermometers that are constantly receiving good reviews and are recommended by amateurs and professionals alike.

This dual probe meat thermometer lets you simultaneously monitor the meat and the internal pit temperature from up to 300 feet away. The probe wires are three feet long and are rated for a maximum temperature of 716 degrees Fahrenheit.

If you’ve used a wireless thermometer before, especially one with two probes, nothing will surprise you about the unit’s setup. It comes with a transmitter that connects to the two probes which are then placed inside your smoker.

You can choose from fifteen presets of different types of meat: beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, deer, elk, moose, buffalo, rabbit, boar, duck, bird and fish. Presets for several degrees of doneness is also offered but also comes with manual settings.

Setup is pretty straightforward. You select the probe then choose what temperature you want. You can also set a temperature range.

An audible alarm sounds when the temperature gauge reaches outside a lower or upper limit which can be turned off. The backlight on the receiver goes out after only five seconds.

This is long enough for a quick temperature reading, but a little bit annoying if what you’re trying to do is change the settings in the dark.

There is also an alert to let you know if a loss of signal has occurred if you go out of range. This is another nice feature to have.

We think that this model works best when used in a smoker setup. The best features of the thermometer really shine when used to measure the pit temperature and meat temperature during a low and slow cook.

The probe wires are rated for temperatures of up to 716 degrees Fahrenheit (380 degrees Celsius).

It comes with an extended five-year warranty on the sensor. If you have any problems or incorrect temperature readings, the company will replace the probes without asking any questions.

In this thermometer, you will find all of the features you would expect to find in a professional kitchen gadget. It has a large and simple LCD display that shows all the important and necessary information.

With the twin probe design, the thermometer can be used to read the temperature of the food and the pit temperature as well as be used as a grill surface thermometer. The screen is backlit and it can be used even in low light conditions.

There are preset temperatures for nine different types of meat (ground beef, ground poultry, veal, chicken, pork, beef, poultry, lamb and fish) and for different levels of doneness (rare, medium rare, medium and well done). You can also manually set your own temperatures.

The receiver, which runs on four AAA batteries, is equipped with alarms, a countdown or count-up timer, and can operate when it is up to 300 feet away from the base.

As far as remote meat thermometers go, this unit is pretty good. It’s a great thermometer for any grill or smoker.

Before the digital era and before everything became electronic, grills used to rely on analog thermometers and they are still considered to be accurate BBQ thermometers and some of the best meat thermometers for grilling.

Some experts also think that this kind of temperature gauge is the best grill surface thermometer for an oven because it’s made of steel and there are no delicate probes or cables that could potentially melt inside the oven.

The unit has a 3 1/8 inch dial face with a 3-inch stem. Installation is super easy, all you need to do is insert the stem through a 7/8 hole on your grill, oven or smoker and attach the installation kit that is included.

The dial has color-coded zones: the blue zone is for temperatures of 100 – 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Smoke and the red zone are for 250 – 350 degrees.

The construction of this heavy duty stainless steel thermometer is meant to last, resisting rust and withstanding weather elements. The glass on the dial is no-fog which helps avoid any condensation under the glass.

This is one of the simpler electron thermometers from the brand. It keeps things simple which means that it’s also cheap. If you’re on a really tight budget, this just might be for you.

This great wired meat thermometer is a single-channel food thermometer with good accuracy and a very good price.

It runs on one AAA battery and has some nice features. There is a temperature measurement function and a countdown timer. When the target temperature is reached or the timer runs out, an audible alert will sound. A countdown timer can be set and an alarm will sound when it times out.

While the timer can run in the background when monitoring food temperature, a countdown timer may expire and you will have to go back to timer mode to silence the alarm.

The target temperature can be selected by choosing the type of meat and the desired degree of doneness. You are able to select any temperature that you desire.

The thermometer has a magnetic back and a 40-inch long stainless steel mesh probe cable. The probe itself can withstand temperatures of up to 716 degrees Fahrenheit.

One disadvantage of this model is that it is not waterproof, so keep it away from splashes and liquids.

This is one of the remote thermometers that you have to use with a mobile device; it does not come with a receiver at all. There is a basic LED display that you can use, but to do things remotely, you will need to pair it with your Android or iOS device.

Fortunately, this is easy to do. The thermometer can connect to a tablet, phone, or laptop using Bluetooth and delivers constant updates.

Instead of having to carry some new gadget around the house, all you need to do is keep your phone handy, which is something you probably already do anyway.

The thermometer is very easy to program since this is taken care of through the app’s interface rather than through a few plastic buttons. The companion app has been designed to be incredibly intuitive and easy to use.

The specifications on the thermometer are pretty nice. It’s available in both one-probe and two-probe versions. We recommend the two-probe version. It’s not that much more expensive and being able to monitor the temperature of the oven or grill along with the food comes in pretty handy.

The Bluetooth transmitter works out to about 300 feet while long cords on the temperature probes enable you to place the base fairly far from your oven or BBQ. Best of all, Lumsing offers a lifetime limited warranty with every unit sold.

They’re pretty confident in the durability of this product, so you don’t have to worry about it breaking or burning out.

As far as downsides go, the temperature probes only go up to about 482 degrees Fahrenheit. Although you certainly don’t want your meat to get anywhere near this hot, it is kind of a limitation on how you can use it to measure your oven or grill temperature.

It’s probably best if you remove the probes from your heating area before you broil or sear anything. But other than that, this digital meat thermometer is pretty great.

It’s perfect if you don’t want to carry around an extra gadget or if you want a user interface that is easy to use. It’s probably not for you if you’re into more serious, heavier cooking.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
So, what is the best smoker thermometer?

<h2>Why Do You Need a Smoker Thermometer?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3788"" title=""best smoker thermometer"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/39.-best-smoker-thermometer.jpg"" alt=""best smoker thermometer"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />

Cooking without an accurate BBQ thermometer is like driving at night without headlights. Invest in a good thermometer or you will end up spending extra money on food that will be ruined later.

A good thermometer will pay for itself by saving your meat and your money.
<h3>Perfectly Cooked Meat</h3>
Without a good thermometer, there’s a good chance you’ll be overcooking or undercooking your meat. Then you’ll have a bunch of guests and family members sick from a foodborne illness.

You can avoid all these things by using a good thermometer that helps you monitor when the food has reached the desired temperature.
<h3>Reliable Detection of Food Temperature</h3>
Using a meat thermometer for smokers is the only way to reliably tell what temperature the food is. Try to avoid those methods that you’ve probably seen on television or have heard people talk about, they are not reliable.

You can’t tell if your meat is done by poking with your hand because different meats have different levels of tenderness. You can’t tell by putting your hand over the grill and counting because not everybody reacts to heat in the same way nor can you do so by cutting the meat because color changes as the meat absorb oxygen.

The only way to tell if your meat is done is with a thermometer, so we strongly recommend that you use one.

<h3>Propane Smokers</h3>
Like the name goes, propane or natural gas smokers basically use propane or natural gas to power them up.

They are simple to use as outdoor smokers and requires nothing more than connecting your smoker to a gas tank, turning it on and powering up the smoker.

Some propane smoker may be co-powered by electricity to help light up the burners, but the major part of fueling is done by gas.

Flavors may not be super amazing with propane smokers compared to other types of smokers, but with the wood chip feature, you should be able to get a good end product.

These types of smokers may not produce larger amounts of food due to the size of their smaller cooking areas.

They are vastly cheaper versions of smokers in general and are the best choice for small families or college students.

<h3>Electric Smokers</h3>
Electric smokers are one of the cheapest power sourced kinds to find on the market. They are sourced by electricity making them very convenient to use and can be used as indoor smokers.

Electricity is widely available in homes and business places which makes the use of these smokers very easy. Use it indoors or outdoors and be ready to make good food. Just connect your smoker to a power source and you are ready to smoke.

It is not very special on flavoring though, but for its convenience, this inexpensive smoker tops all the rest. Also, if there is a power outage at a time when you are trying to make some food, this may be a challenge as you will not be able to your smoker.

Electric smokers are mostly designed for feeding small numbers so if you are considering having a big party, you may need to be plan way ahead to enable you to make food in turns.

This smoker is best loved for its affordability yet great effective results. If you are in search of the best budget smoker, this is the one to check out.

Due to its build, it tends to retain heat within the smoker for a very even cook. This is one of the features that you should look out for when buying a smoker because anything less than this will defeat the entire purpose for which you are smoking food.

To top it all off, it comes with an added remote control to regulate temperatures even while away from the smoker. The remote control works in correlation with the temperature and timer control situated at the top of the smoker.

In the off chance you forget to check on your smoker during the cooking process, you can set the timer to the ideal doneness time, and once the timer is up, it will automatically shut down to prevent any forms of havoc.

<h3>Pellet Smokers</h3>
Why pellet smokers when there are charcoal smokers?

Well, pellet smokers are calmer versions to charcoal smokers, and by this we mean they are equally great for flavoring food with very traditional aromas, but they offer a more subtle approach to flavoring.

Unlike charcoal smokers that cook with very intense smoking, pellets smokers are mild on flavors.

So, if you hate strong aromas, then having a pellet smoker will be the one for you.

Pellets may burn faster if not managed well which may cost extra for fueling which is why we give the advice to have good management when using them.

<h3>Offset Smokers</h3>
Offset smokers, which are the best wood smokers, are wonderful for infusing your food with amazing smoky flavors which fall in as one of the 2 options purposely designed for this result. The other being charcoal smokers.

Offset smokers are designed to cook many different types of foods such as brisket, pork shoulder, turkey, sausage or even fish using indirect heat and are solely used as outdoor smokers because of the amount of smoke they produce.

They are designed to feed larger numbers of people as they have a grill chamber for food and side firebox for the fire both connected by a chamber where heat and smoke derived from the firebox finds its way through the chamber and cooks the food in the grilling area.

Offset smokers always equipped with a chimney which allows you to control and regulate the amount of smoke and or heat with your smoker. These smokers are great for anyone looking to invest in a new backyard smoker or even a commercial smoker.

The chimney also serves as a determinant of the kind of fire in the firebox that’s cooking. Thick heavy smoke usually means there is little oxygen not entering the firebox, hence the vent will need to be opened to let in air.

As a result, these kinds of smokers are great for flavoring food and you can expect to amaze your guests with the food turnout. You may want to consider this if smoke flavors are a big thing to you.

These amazing smokers are the top-rated smokers used in BBQ competitions worldwide. If you plan on competing, an offset drum smoker would be the best smoker to buy.

Cost may be higher for offset smokers, but the obvious features contribute to its pricing. So, it is safe to say that they are good smokers to have despite the higher prices.

The liberty to cook any kind of way can now be determined by the way you feel and not by your limitations.

It is also the best meat smoker to have despite the weather changes; use it in hot weathers with the charcoal side or in cold weathers with the gas side.

The infrared side allows you to create a perfect sear on your food which is that essential.

Temperatures are checked for great results; use the adjustable charcoal pan to aid in controlling heat to produce excellent food for large crowds from its massive cooking space.

This smoker is best for its 4 in 1 versatility and we give it two thumbs up also for being an under $1000 smoker.

<h2>Which are the overall best smokers?</h2>
Having gone through the different kinds of smokers and their fueling types, certain features are clear to have when considering the best type of smoker or the top-rated smokers that are available.

First, they should be very well constructed, made with materials that are long-lasting and will withstand the test of time and weather conditions. A great smoker should be able to last you for at least 5 years on average without any major repair issues.

Next, it should have a good cooking surface area, something that is above 300 square inches. You want to be able to make food for at least 3 people in one turn, so aim for something that will offer more.

Also ensure that its weight is not so much that you are unable to move your smoker from one place to another. You may need to carry it over for a party at a friend’s house or simply just change the location of where it is positioned at home.

It should have a built-in and well readable thermometer. Insist on this feature as temperatures are imperative when it comes to knowing how hot your smoker is during the cooking process.

Finally, look out for warranty options. A manufacturer that offers no warranty options is suspicious. They are likely to have faults with products being made and may have escaped the notification of the manufacturer. A smoker that comes with a warranty will always be a better option than one without.
<h2>Why it is essential to always buy the best available?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-3818"" title=""Best Smoker"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/32.-Best-Smoker.jpg"" alt=""Best Smoker"" width=""300"" height=""612"" />

First of all, there’s a need to ask yourself a few questions about what your real desires are when it comes to smoking.

If you are a newcomer to smoking, we will urge you to read our article on <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-smoker/"">how to use a smoker</a> to give you a better understanding of smokers which will answer these questions.
<h3>Does the type of fuel really matter?</h3>
Maybe you are all about the type of food you want to produce and not necessarily worried about how the machine is fueled to produce it.

The fact of the matter is that the fuel type does not necessarily affect the outcome or temperatures of the end product. The doneness of the food is not affected by the type of fuel used to cook, so this gives you much more room to explore the type of smoker that will suit you best.

Look through the various options for what is most convenient for you and have your purchase driven by it.
<h3>Creating specific flavors will play a role on the type of smoker</h3>
The type of fuel will play a major role in the overall flavor and taste of the end product. While propane or charcoal will develop those classic grilled flavors everyone has come to love, different types of wood and pellets will act as a flavor profile for your end product.

Some woods like mesquite, hickory and oak will smolder very easily and create a very even and heavy smoke flavor. While nut and fruit woods tend to have a heavier smoke with a lighter flavor.

Keep in mind the type of end product you are wanting and how easy or difficult you want the cooking process to be when choosing a smoker to fit your basic needs.
<h3>Ensure that it is what you really want</h3>
At the end of the day, the choice is going to be yours which is why we advise you to put your desires first before anything else.

Buy a smoker that you will get you excited to cook every time. Create a personal list of what you will want in a smoker, and match the features as you research.

<h2>3. Smoked Chicken</h2>
Some people like to BBQ/grill chicken, others like to smoke chicken . As for me I prefer the smoked chicken. To have a crispy skin on the chicken it has to be smoked around 325-350 F temp.

Anytime you smoke your meat it comes down to what flavor of wood do you like. Apple wood chips gives you a nice flavor. Once you try my recipe I can guarantee you you won’t go back to BBQ/grilling.

<h2>Why a Grill Cleaner is a Must Have?</h2>
Not taking care of your grill or even your oven one can have some serious effects upon it. If not cleaned regularly, the food accumulates and then it starts to get stained.

With repetitive uses without good cleaning, the metal can start to rust and break down. In addition to that, the gas released from the burned food may stick to the meat onto your next use making it toxic for your health.

What we will do for you is to review all of the 5 best grill cleaners mentioned above with criteria such as the time taken to clean them, if it is practical, how much effort is needed and if it really removed the food easily as advertised.
<h2>Reviews of the Best Grill Cleaners for 2018</h2>
<h3>1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRRNM7X?tag=brobbq-accessories-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Weber Grill Cleaner Spray</a></h3>
Now Weber is one of the leading manufacturers of grilling and its accessories. Providing what they perceive to be the best grill cleaner products, they have extended their range of products to the cleaning side of it.

Their products are always trustworthy since they manufacture them specifically for certain everyday issues you might encounter. Now taking the product as an example, it is one of the most practical tools you have in your kitchen for cleaning, especially for grills.

You don't have to worry having it around the kitchen since this barbecue grill cleaner is certified non-toxic and does not irritate your skin either. What is great about it is that it has exceeded the international standard in terms of biodegradability.

Since it is in spray form, you can adjust the nozzle to spray on wide and as well as difficult to reach areas. It is easy to use for your grill cleaning as we have tested.

As for the way of using it, just spray or apply onto your grill cooking grates as well as the grease soiled area. Allow 1-2 minutes so that the liquid can penetrate the grease and sticky/burnt meat after which, take a wet towel and start wiping it clean.

The BBQ grill cleaner works really well on to both grill and grill plates. If you follow the directions then nothing out of the expected should happen. A difference we have seen while we tried it is that the grill plates as well as the stainless grates are shinier than before after having used the product on it.

It can be put to multiple uses.

Advertised as being ideal for the cleaning of barbecue grills, broiler pans, oven and oven doors, it does its work with heightened expertise.

Now if you have booked a part of the day only for deep cleaning, it is ideal too for the same reason. It is also apparently designed to penetrate tough grease and food spills and lets out a fresh scent upon spraying.

As for the ways of using this stainless steel grill cleaner, you should always hold the can upright to avoid inhaling the contents when spraying. Make sure you wear long gloves.

Spray once and then wait a minimum of 5 minutes before applying it on the grill plates. If used inside over, wait 20 minutes for cold oven and 5 for heated ones.

The model works pretty well for tough grease and sticky burnt food as we tried. You, however, need to make sure you follow the directions so that you do not harm yourself.

Magic Stone makes them with pure glass meaning you will essentially avoid getting contaminated by substances such as cadmium and arsenic. The good thing about the steam cleaner is that microorganism cannot use them as hosts hence reducing the chance of getting serious skin infections.

This grill cleaner spray does not absorb any vapors or liquid either meaning you don't have to worry about it being damaged in your kitchen or garage.

With this one, you are assured of having a quality consistent product since the brick density is controlled too with its 5cm thickness.

If you’ve ever tried spray on a grill and the content goes right through it, then the magic stone is probably right for you. Just be prepared to oil your elbows since it might take a few bricks to get the desired result.

The grill cleaner is eco-friendly, non-toxic and easy to use as such.

The substance is biodegradable, non-toxic as well as non-flammable.

Once applied the correct way, it triggers a powerful foam reaction the starts breaking off the grease. You should always test it on a small area (hidden) before cleaning the required surface or grill.

As for the directions of use, make sure to brush off the charred deposit first wearing protective gloves. On a cool grill, spray full onto it and let the liquid soak for 1-5 minutes. Then clean with a brush until the greasy stuffs are loosened after which, you can rinse it with cool water.

Although the liquid lacks some active ingredients via chemicals, it does a good job cleaning charred surfaces of charcoal along with the barbecue grill itself. Also the grime can sometimes turn green which may require you to brush it off once it dries.

You should probably keep it in a safe area even though it is non-toxic to some extent, it does trigger some foaming reaction meaning there are some chemicals in it.

<h2>Why Is It So Important to Have a Grill Brush?</h2>
Barbecue has been in our DNA since long ago and not taking care of it properly is almost a crime of nature. The barbecue or oven grill if not taken care of, despite how strong it might be, will start accumulating food and rust.

Once it starts, it will start burning up on each use along with the accumulated grease upon it which might prove to be toxic once the burnt gases stick to the food you ingest.

So in order to help you from choosing and stop you from harming yourself by using a grill brush which doesn’t do the job as advertised, we decided to review the top 5 best grill cleaning brush.

Since it’s a grill or BBQ brush, the criteria we will use to determine the best is the price, the weight since you’ll be using your elbow, the effectiveness of the brush, and the amount of time taken to clean the entire grill as well as the cast iron grates.

This tool is probably one of the best on the market right now. It is a great alternative for people who want bristle free grill brushes that may sometimes damage their grill plates. Having 3 brushes in 1 is also pretty unique.

For maximum cleaning efficiency, it's better if you dip the brush in water while cleaning. One of the best things about buying one of those is that it has a pretty long reach and thus, you can use it in flexible corners and angles as well as for keeping your hand away from the heat.

Since it has a long reach, it requires much less effort than your average brush with has shorter reach.
It is also practical in a way that it can be used for all other types of grill brands and grates meaning you can have another brand of grill and use this brush to clean it. While good for all of the above, it is also a pretty good grill brush for stainless steel grates.
It is pretty easy to use it. While cleaning with your brush, always keep a bowl of cold or hot water next to you.

You can use the brush with one hand but could use both for less effort. From time to time, dip the brush in the water to get rid of the sticky content. Repeat the process around 2 to 3 times and you can rinse it when done.

<h3>2.<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009IH0BYQ?tag=brobbq-accessories-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> Weber 6494 12-Inch 3-Sided Grill Brush</a></h3>

And as you would have guessed, its product is of high quality as well.

The tool is easy to use and easily fits tight angles like the space between the edges of the grates and the grates rod. It also has a tight ergonomic grip which helps support your wrist (making it one of the safest grill brushes for you) and helps in adjusting the movement pressure of your hand while cleaning.

This one has a wide brush head meaning it can cover large areas at once. The ergonomic handle helps with controlling the brush while the shorter sides help reach and clean the hard areas.

It is made of stainless steel, which is strong enough to resist wear and tear. Although it advertises many of these as features, some of them are true while most are so-so and not 100% true.

For example, since the brush wires are thin, once they break and fall, it’s practically impossible to see them. The brush is also subject to rust since you are dipping it in water.

It is also not multi-purpose since constant use of this grill brush for porcelain grates will eventually flake it. Since we’ve managed to check all this first hand, let’s play out their pros and cons.

It is made of stainless steel and unlike other brushes (especially brass grill brushes); you can apply as much force as required and it will not leave marks on your grate, porcelain or grill.

The length being 18 inches, it is perfect to keep your hand away from the heat. Even then you will still have plenty of control over the scrubbing.

You could probably say it is the best for porcelain grates. The only special feature that distinguishes it from the others though is the triple head it has.

If you had to call a brush 'beast', then it would be this one. The prerequisite of using it are almost the same as the others.

First you have to pre-heat the grill. Then start brushing while holding the extremity of the handle. Once you are done, wash the brush with hot water.

To finish, just rinse the grill with cold water then let it dry.
In some cases if you might get the brush with a replaceable head, which is pretty good for the price, you are paying.

It is one of those much-loved 3 in 1 tools. As advertised, it does indeed clean the same scrubbing area about 4-5 times faster without leaving any scratches or marks on the surface.

As a plus, it can be used to clean about any type of barbecue grill such as gas, charcoal, smokers and so on.

The handle has woven steel designed to handle extra pressure upon it meaning it is very hard for it to break or bend.

A few downsides to it might be that the brush wires are a bit easy to fall off since they are so close together while cleaning. It is also not advised to use it on porcelain grates since it might break it or damage the surface.

Once you follow the instructions, it won't scratch your grates or even leave marks on any surface.

If you have pretty food spills stuck onto your grates, then this is probably the one brush you would want to buy. As most of the brushes in the top 5, this tool is compatible with other brands of grills – that is a plus also in our book.

The main part that is the handle of the unit is more solid than average handle which is pretty durable. Also as opposed to other brushes, the bristles/wires do not fall off easily, seemingly strongly attached within the handle.

<h2>Why a Grill Cover is So Essential for Your BBQ Grill?</h2>
A grill cover is a necessity nowadays if you have any type of grill since the cover will protect it from most kinds of external dangers (weather). As a result, the cover will extend the life of your grill.

Grill covers protect your grill from moist air that can damage most grills that are made up of iron. The moisture along with oxygen in the atmosphere and from the heat of your cooking will get your grill to start rusting.

By wrapping your grill in a good grill cover material will protect it as well as increase its efficiency and durability meaning it is always in top shape and ready to be used throughout the month or year. It also saves your time from moving your appliance from inside to outside repeatedly which might make it wear faster.

As a result, it does save you a good amount of money since your grill will remain functional longer with the use of a cover.

<h2>1. Make your smoker choice from the lot by powering kind.</h2>

<h2>2. Prepare your food first before anything else.</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4047"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2.-Prepare-your-food-first-before-anything-else.jpg"" alt=""2. Prepare your food first before anything else"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Before starting up and preheating your food, the first thing you want to consider is getting your meat, veggies etc all prepped up first.

By this we mean, cleaning up your food, taking away unnecessary fats and marinating your food with fresh spices.

Usually marination takes at least 30 minutes to be effective, so you want to ensure that you are giving the food enough time to absorb as much flavors as desired.
<h2>3. Preheat your smoker in readiness for the food</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4048"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3.-Preheat-your-smoker-in-readiness-for-the-food.jpg"" alt=""3. Preheat your smoker in readiness for the food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Once the food is spiced and tucked in the refrigerator to be marinated, you should power up your smoker and get it preheated before the food is introduced.

Start up your smoker and get it heated up to a temperature range of 250 oF to 350 oF.

Do bare in mind that before the food is introduced into the smoker, the temperature will have to be dropped to between 225 oF to 250 oF. This ensures that the food is cooked in a fairly heated environment.

Preheating the smoker allows for two main things: it disinfects the smoker of any germs, and creates a warm environment to get the food to start cooking once it is placed in it.
<h2>4. Start the smoky flavor creation process.</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4049"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/4.-Start-the-smoky-flavor-creation-process..jpg"" alt=""4. Start the smoky flavor creation process."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Without any further introduction, adding smoky flavors to your barbecue when cooking is a key aspect to grilling great food.

For this reason, almost all smokers make provision for flavored wood chips to be added to the cooking process.

Select your preferred flavored wood chip, soak it for at least 30 minutes in preparation to be used.

After 30 minutes, drain the water off the wood chips and fill the wood chip loader built in your smoker with the wood chips. Fill the loader with as much wood chips that it can take per time.
<h2>5. Create moisture for your cook.</h2>
Moisture is also a key aspect for getting the best food results on your food, and so this should be the next step before introducing the food.

Some smokers come with a water pan usually located at the bottom of the smoker beneath the grill grates. The essence of this pan is to be filled with water, spices and herbs which will be evaporated upwards to the food during the cooking process, creating moisture during the cook.

If you do not have a water pan already located in the smoker, you can always use an aluminum pan to serve this need.

Fill up the pan with water and some choice herbs, and place it beneath the grill grates positioned to be directly under the food.
<h2>6. Close the lid of the smoker to continue preheating.</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4050"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6.-Close-the-lid-of-the-smoker-to-continue-preheating..jpg"" alt=""6. Close the lid of the smoker to continue preheating."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Once, the wood chips and water pan are positioned well, do not introduce the food just yet.

Remember that the goal is to get the smoker to be in good heat before the food comes in. So, close the door of the smoker and secure it with its latching lock if it has one to lock as much heat in.

Leave the smoker to keep preheating up to your required temperature gauge. You can use the attached readable thermometer situated on the smoker to help you determine the right temperature.
<h2>7. Time for the food</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4040"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/7.-Time-for-the-food.jpg"" alt=""7. Time for the food"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Once the smoker has preheated to your desired temperature, it is now a good time to get your food cooking.

By this time your food will have marinated well, and will be in good shape to be introduced to some heat.

Open the door of the smoker and with the help of a ladle, place the meat on the grill grates directly over the water pan.

Position the food in a manner that allows it to have the best heat access as you will desire.
<h2>8. Baste your food to prevent it from drying out.</h2>
Before closing the smoker, baste your food with some liquid spices. This can be a blend of ginger, peppers, onions or any ideal spice blend of your choice.

Use a clean basting brush to apply the spice on the food, meat especially, in moderate quantities.

This is to ensure the food does not dry out during the cook as an addition to the moisture being created in the smoker from the water pan. Basting also adds some flavoring to the food as it cooks. ‘

Thereafter, close the lid of the smoker bearing in mind that you will not be opening the smoker for about the next hour or two. Reduce the heat to between 225 oF and 250 oF and start cooking.
<h2>9. Add some more wood chips</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4041"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/9.-Add-some-more-wood-chips.jpg"" alt=""9. Add some more wood chips"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Halfway into the cooking process, you may want to refill the wood chip loader with some wood chips as the earlier load may have burned out.

This is to ensure that the smoky flavors that is being given to the food is still in full force for super flavored foods.

You may soak the wood chips in water ahead of time or use unsoaked wood chips instead. The results are of no much difference.
<h2>10. Keep your eye on the thermometer</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4042"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/10.-Keep-your-eye-on-the-thermometer.jpg"" alt=""10. Keep your eye on the thermometer"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

The thermometer is the only unit during the cook that will let you know of the food’s state of doneness. So, you want to ensure that your thermometer is of accurate read.

Constantly, check the heat levels of the food with the thermometer and if you happen to have too much heat or smoke circulating in the smoker, use the caveats situated at the top and/ or sides of the smoker to let out smoke and heat.

Make the thermometer your counterpart when smoking and you will be sure to get the best doneness on your foods.
<h2>11. Add some finishing sauce to the food as preferred</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4043"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/11.-Add-some-finishing-sauce-to-the-food-as-preferred.jpg"" alt=""11. Add some finishing sauce to the food as preferred"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

About this time, the food should be about 15 to 10 minutes up to doneness. This is a good time to apply some finishing sauce to the food to enhance the taste.

You may use hot sauces or to go easy, use a common BBQ sauce, and you will be amazed at the flavors and taste that will be derived.

This process, however, is not a compulsory step and can be skipped if you are not big on much flavoring or the recipe does not allow for this step to applied. If this is the case move to the next step.
<h2>12. The food is ready</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4044"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/12.-The-food-is-ready.jpg"" alt=""12. The food is ready"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Once the timer is done, carefully remove the food onto a serving platter using a heat proof ladle.

Let the food sit for 5 to 10 minutes before you actually start serving. This allows it to cook further making the spices settle in nicely for a great bite. It also allows the food cool well to avoid mouth burns.

Share your food with family and friends, and be on the standby to be applauded for a great cook.

<h2>A great electric smoker should have these basic things.</h2>
You are probably excited and getting convinced with regards to getting an electric smoker already, but just quickly before you jump into getting just anyone of them, you may want to read further to find out what the top rated electric smokers consist of.

Also, read our write-up on <a href=""https://brobbq.com/how-to-use-an-electric-smoker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>how to use an electric smoker</strong></a> to give you a better understanding of electric smokers work for your perfect buy.
<h3>Are they built strong and sturdy?</h3>
You may often waive off this feature when a buying device like this because of the excitement to get one and start using soon enough. However, the “soon enough” feeling may be a disastrous one in the next year or two if you do not stress on making a purchase that is built with strong materials to handle heavy duty cooking.

Electric smokers are one of the great kinds to use in all weathers; be it cold or warm weathers which means that the wear and tear rate on these kinds are higher as some of them allow for both indoor and outdoor use.

Make sure it is sturdily built with materials like steel and coated with porcelain for example. These materials stand the test of time.
<h3>Consider your average serving size</h3>
Dear reader, you will not be cooking for yourself and significant other only, you will need to make provision for other people.

At the same time, you may not be up for cooking for very big numbers, so you should do a calculation of the target number of people you will want to serve at a party in your house.

This way, your smoker gets to make food for both domestic offerings and for bigger celebrations. This does not mean buying a gigantic smoker to satisfy party needs, your sizable smoker should be able to do 3 to 6 rounds of foods to feed the numbers that you desire.
<h3>Money, money, money! Put this into consideration.</h3>
An electric smoker is a great asset to have but does not mean, the bank has to suffer for this.

Prepare your budget way ahead of time and stick to it, however, making it flexible for a little add up or deduction.

Do not go head on to just buying a smoker grill because we said electric smokers are the fastest producing kinds to have. They come in various prices based on brand names, sizes etc.

Look out for the price that fits you best and still has all the amazing qualities that you need.
Proceed to make you purchase from there!
<h3>It should definitely have a flavoring component.</h3>
No compromising on this! Flavors and BBQs go together without doubt, so every smoker must have a flavoring component so as an electric smoker.

Every good electric smoker must have a wood chip box to allow you load flavored wood chips to boost up the smoky flavors in your food when cooking.

These chip loaders are specially designed and structured for this purpose, so this goes to tell you that if you ever need those smoky flavors in your food, and your electric smoker does not have this feature, you cannot put your wood chips in a pan and place it in the smoker with hopes to get your smoky flavors. Come on, it will not work!

Insist on this feature, it is better to have than not to.
<h2>What should your best value option have?</h2>
Now, go deeper into what your best choice should have. Like a girlfriend or boyfriend, you definitely have those unshakeable qualities that you definitely want to have. Well, so as an electric smoker. It is your choice so you must get the best that melts your heart.
<h3>It should be easy to use and maintain.</h3>
Nobody wants to battle with a smoker before you can make food, and we know you do not want this either. Do a good read on reviews to be sure that the pretty looking smoker is not problematic to use.

This is where warranties come in, so you should insist on buying a device that has warranty coverage. Just so you can return the smoker to the manufacturers if it has some production issues that should not be your burden to bear.

Using a smoker should be as simple as reciting ABC especially for domestic users. Most electric are hence designed to serve this need, so any kind that does not offer it should be strongly questioned.
<h3>Ensure temperature and heat control are instituted</h3>
Without further say, temperature and heat control are essential for smoking food, and we thought we should stress on it again.

Simply because this is an electric smoker does not mean that once you power up the device and tuck your food in, everything is going to work out just fine. You will need to take charge of these controls.

Most electric smokers have a thermometer and timer built in them to allow you set the temperature and time for how you will like the food to be cooked.

They should also have caveats which are small ventilation systems which allows for releasing heat and smoke while cooking for a stable internal temperature.
<h3>Will the smoker fit well in your space?</h3>
Most electric smokers can be used both indoors and outdoors, and are usually not grand in size like other kinds of smokers.

If using the smoker outdoor, you may have plenty of space to position it, but if you may need to use it indoors, this is where space becomes a crucial factor.

As a result, use your indoor space as a yardstick for determining the size of your smoker so that you can have the best fit in both areas.
You also, want to ensure that its size is portable enough to have you move it around with ease. Like we said, most electric smokers are great on the outlook size, but weight can only be determined when you try moving it around.

Look out for its weight dimension; most manufacturers will list this for you, and be sure that you will be able to carry it, say with the help of another person before you buy it.
<h3>Your ideal smoker should be able to do at least two kinds of cook.</h3>
At least, it should be able to grill and smoke while other functions can be to roast, sear, bake etc.

However, you want to consider killing two birds with a stone, so ensure that this feature is made available.

The essence of devices, be it smokers or a phone, a washing machine etc., is to be able to perform a particular function in 2 or more forms, so versatility has to be key when making your choice of an electric smoker.

Look out for the other function that you will so desire to have and base your buy on it.
<h3>The grill grates should aid with layer structuring.</h3>
You will not be grilling sausages, or burgers all the days of your smoking life. There will be a need to grill a full turkey or larger portions and this is where flexibility will serve you well.

Aim for adjustable grill grates that allow you reposition your grates to fit the food in well for a great cook even if it is a small electric smoker.

If the beautiful looking, affordable smoker has non-adjustable grill grates, we back you up to gladly tuck that choice to the side.Focus on this option of flexibility and you will make a variety of recipes for years.

The trick to having adjustable grill grates also aids with creating extra cooking space within. So, like we said earlier about cooking spaces, this feature is an influencer to making your choice.

It is a double walled built kind making the insulation of heat one that is of great benefits to the food being cooked.

It is a cheaper smoker than many out there, being an under $250 type, but comes with 4 adjustable cooking racks to give you great control of your space creation needs.

Its special feature is its glass door that allows the user view foods while it cooks. This kills the urge to open the smoker while cooking which is bound to happen due to the eagerness to see the turnout of the food while it cooks. So, you can view the food at ease while it cooks.

It offers a blue LED display screen to help you view the cooking temperature of the food for any forms of adjustments necessary. You can also remove its thermometer for other purposes which is beneficial for budget saving if there is the need to purchase a thermometer for other uses.

Although, there have been complaints of the thermometer reading incorrectly sometimes. So, maybe a backup food thermometer may be necessary if you face this problem

It comes with a grease tray for trapping grease and juices when cooking and a large stainless steel locking latch for keeping the door tightly locked when cooking. This is essential for ensuring a good sit of heat within the smoker during the cook.

Finally mobility is made easy with its wheels and integrated handles, and like we said ensure that your choice if portable enough. This smoker offers this feature beautifully.

It comes with a smoke flavor creation box, which takes care of the needs of smoky flavors in your food. However, for its high price above $300, this smoker offers all the basic features that we speak of and nothing extra for the added cents.

It has 4 cooking grates in total with 3 being adjustable for space. This is actually not a bad feature as you will be able to create just enough space for your needs.

It has a great steel build, which is very essential for weather changes, and has a 400 watt heating element to create good heat for an excellent cook.

Position its drip pan well before cooking, and you can be sure that cleaning afterwards will not be a problem at all.

Finally, is its fiberglass insulation system which is a more advanced form for locking the right levels of heat in the smoker while you cook. Since, the right heat is a determinant for great food turnouts; we especially like this smoker for this feature.

It is below $100 making it our favorite electric smoker for the money.

It has a 1, 400W heating element which makes it a power booster for great food. For its cost, we think this feature makes it a great asset to have with guarantees that you will have the best control of heat.

It sits in 2 chrome coated racks ideal for small cooks, say for a family of 4. In 2 to 3 rounds, you can go on to making dinner for when the in-laws, and a few cousins come by your house. The results from the grills are also amazing leaving such pretty sear marks on your food after cooking.

Not many electric smokers have this water pan feature, so we especially like <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-electric-smokers-under-200/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this affordable home electric smoker</a> for it.

Controlling temperatures here is superb as it offers three levels for its temperature gauge settings; high, medium and low which is great way to control temperatures for an entry level smoker.

It is the only smoker on our list that offers an RF remote system that allows the user control temperatures from a short distance away from the smoker.

There have been very few complaints about its remote not synchronizing well with the smoker’s controls, but we believe this can be solved on the back of the warranty offering in case you encounter this problem.

This means its integrated thermostat temperature control system is accurately built ensuring that temperatures and time are easy to set and read accurately even when placed under direct sunlight, thanks to its blue LED display.

Proceed to controlling heat within the smoker by using its side and/ or top air dampers for this.

It is a very durable build with a full foam insulation system to keep heat within the smoker allowing for a cool touch on the outside while it cooks.

We love it for its quick ignition system. It sits separate burners for oven heat and wood smoke which means an easier fire lighting feature, and a total control on the levels of heat that cooks your food.

It comes with 4 grilling racks within and a fully heat insulated feature for a great and even cook.
Use the racks for making as much food as your will desire, approximately for 4 people in one turn. Hence, more in 3 to 4 turns.

It sits in an automatic wood feeder system which means all you need to do on creating smoke flavors will be to load your wood chips and leave it. This system will automatically feed the smoke generator wood chips as and when there is a need.

Its digital controls are great for adjusting time, temperature and even smoke settings; this gives you all the control that you need to create the best atmosphere within your food for the best of foods.

It is a decently priced smoker and for a brand that is not as commonly known, this is a typical example of a purchase that should not be driven by brand names.

We will have loved it to come with a water pan for creating moisture which will have made it all the better, but guess what, you can always use an aluminum tray to serve this purpose.

4328,"How To Use A Charcoal Grill In 14 Pictured Steps","Grilling food is one of the fastest ways to barbecue and by using a charcoal grill, you will be in for flavors that cannot be traded with anything else.

Grilling with charcoal is the best traditional form of cooking meats, hamburgers, pork ribs etc as it takes you to deep smoky roots.

Hence, in this article we share easy steps with pictures to teach you how to use a charcoal grill to achieve great flavored food that is scrumptious on all sides.

Come along as we explore them!
<h2>1. First, you need a charcoal grill and some charcoal</h2>
Charcoal grills are very different from charcoal smokers with most of them coming in smaller sizes and designed for a quick cook.

Do a good scan on the market if you do not have one to help you get the best that will fit your needs.

In our article on the <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-charcoal-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>best charcoal grills</strong></a>, we share 10 different kinds that will serve as a good guide for you for making a good choice.

You will also need a bag of charcoal which will be the sole source of fueling.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.-First-you-need-a-charcoal-grill-and-some-charcoal..jpg"" alt="""" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>2. Next, clean the grates thoroughly</h2>
This is a critical part of the grilling process whether you are using a brand new smoker or an existing one.

With the help of a grill brush, brush the grates thoroughly to remove any hardened grease, dust or ashes sitted on the grates.

These components if not removed could find their way into the food while you cook in the form of germs and can be harmful to the health.

Insist on not missing this step.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4331"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2.-Next-clean-the-grates-thoroughly.jpg"" alt=""2. Next, clean the grates thoroughly"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>3. Fill the fire box with charcoal</h2>
Once the grill grates are well cleaned, remove them and fill the fire box with as much charcoal as you will need.

Do ensure to use a decent amount of charcoal when you start cooking as you will not want to heat up your grill too much.

It is often better to start with an average amount of charcoal for good heat, and in the middle of grilling your food, you may add up some more charcoal.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4332"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3.-Fill-the-fire-box-with-charcoal.jpg"" alt=""3. Fill the fire box with charcoal"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>4. Light up the charcoal with a chimney</h2>
In this step, we teach you how to light your coals with a chimney.

A chimney as seen below is widely sold and affordable aimed at helping you light your charcoal with ease.

Pour some amount of charcoal, two thirds way up the chimney. With the help of lighter, light the coals through the holes situated at the bottom of the chimney.

Once a few coals have lighted, leave the chimney in open air to allow all or most of the coals to light.

Once lighted, pour the coals in the unlighted charcoal in the grill with the lid open for the charcoal to light up.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4333"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4.-Light-up-the-charcoal-with-a-chimney..jpg"" alt=""4. Light up the charcoal with a chimney."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>5. You can also use organic fire starter for lighting</h2>
This may be an easier option for lighting up your coals as they light up pretty fast.

Purchase some organic fire starters as seen in the picture below and arrange 4 to 5 of them in the charcoal already poured in the grill. Ensure to spread them out.

With the help of a lighter, light the fire starters and leave them in the open air to light the charcoal to the level of fire that you desire.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4334"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5.-You-can-also-use-organic-fire-starter-for-lighting.jpg"" alt=""5. You can also use organic fire starter for lighting"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>6. Or you can use an electric starter to light your coals</h2>
This is the most easiest form of lighting your coals. All you need is an electric starter and an electricity source.

Place the device in the charcoal in the fire box, light it up and leave it to light the coals.

Once you have a good number of coals lighted, turn of the starter and remove it. Leave the coals in the open air to have some more coals lighted.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4335"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/6.-Or-you-can-use-an-electric-starter-to-light-your-coals..jpg"" alt=""6. Or you can use an electric starter to light your coals."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>7. Close the lid</h2>
Once the coals are lighting up fast, close the lid of the grill with the vents and dampers opened.

This will preheat the grill, killing any existing germs in the grill and preparing it for the food to come in.

Aim at heating the grill up to a range of 350 oF to 400 oF. You can determine the temperature level using the thermometer attached to the grill.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4336"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/7.-Close-the-lid..jpg"" alt=""7. Close the lid."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>8. Open the lid to prepare for the food</h2>
Once the grill is well heated, carefully open the lid and take off the grill grates.

You will ought to be extra careful in this process as the grill and grates will be very hot.

Using a heat proof fire ladle, spread out the coal to have an even concentration of heat across the firebox.

Afterwards, place the grates back.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4337"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/8.-Open-the-lid-to-prepare-for-the-food..jpg"" alt=""8. Open the lid to prepare for the food."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>9. Prepare the grates</h2>
Before the food is placed on the grates, they will need to be oiled to ensure that the food doesn't stick to the grates.

Using a grill application brush coated with oil, evenly spread oil on all sides of the grates.

Ensure to not use too much oil to avoid dripping into the fire as this will create a lot of unwanted smoke for the food.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4338"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9.-Prepare-the-grates.jpg"" alt=""9. Prepare the grates"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>10. Start cooking.</h2>
Next, place your food on the grill grates in a well arranged manner with enough space between the foods.

Ensure that you food has been well marinated with the right spices as you prefer.

Also, make sure to place a necessary amount of food on the grates without overcrowding. This may affect the doneness of the food if ignored.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4339"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/10.-Start-cooking..jpg"" alt=""10. Start cooking."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>11. Close the lid again</h2>
It is a must do practice to always close the lid of your grill for at least one and a half hours once the food has been introduced.

This is to ensure the food is cooked in a stable temperature without heat interruptions that may affect the doneness of the foods.

Also, keep the food in the desired temperature hot enough to cook the food fast but without burning.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4340"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/11.-Close-the-lid-again.jpg"" alt=""11. Close the lid again"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>12. Regulate temperatures using the dampers and vents</h2>
Every charcoal grill comes with dampers and vents to aid you in controlling heat or temperatures.

As grilling aims at cooking food faster, you want to ensure that the level of heat in the grill is not too low which will cause it to cook for a longer period of time causing it to smoke.

Opening the dampers or vents at different levels determine the amount of airflow that will go in and out of the grill.

Determine the amount of heat against the amount of air that you want have, and control the these using the dampers and/ or vents.

Use the thermometer attached to the grill to help you in determining the best temperatures for your food.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4341"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/12.-Regulate-temperatures-using-the-dampers-and-vents.jpg"" alt="""" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>13. Remove the food</h2>
After the desired time of cook under the right temperatures, your food should be well done and ready to be served.

Carefully open the lid and remove the food onto a platter.

You can also use a food thermometer to check the inner doneness of the food to be sure that it is well cooked before it is served.

If not, keep the food cooking over the fire, close the lid and keep cooking for a few more minutes. After, open it and get ready to serve.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/13.-Remove-the-food..jpg"" alt=""13. Remove the food."" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
<h2>14. Clean the grates immediately</h2>
The practice of cleaning your grates after eating is a very wrong thing to do.

The best time to clean the grates is while it is still warm, hence, ensure to brush every stuck food on the grates away while it is still hot.

You can do this even while the grill still has some fire in it. This is to ensure that a proper clean is done while the food residue is still soft.

Once the coals are quenched and the grill has totally cooled, you can then wash the grill with some soapy water and metal sponge.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4343"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/14.-Clean-the-grates-immediately.jpg"" alt=""14. Clean the grates immediately"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<h3>1. Be adventurous with your charcoal kind</h3>
There are two main kinds of charcoal pieces to use for grilling with different ways of operation. These are lump charcoals and charcoal briquettes. Their essence are driven by their lighting style.

Charcoal lumps are often bigger in size and quicker to light, but are the fastest to burn out.

On the opposite, briquettes are harder in nature, slower to light and long lasting.

Based on the your time essence and the level of heat that you are hoping to achieve per time, either of these types will serve your needs well based on their nature.
<h3>2. Marinate your food for an hour.</h3>
Due to the fact that grilling is a fast cooking way of barbecuing, an appropriate way of locking in as much flavor in your food is to marinate it for a long time, at least for an hour.

Use fresh spices, veggies and some oil to marinate your foods and you will be blown away by the great taste and aromas that will be derived from your cook.

The oil component in the marinade will aid in creating some crunchiness to the food. Try not to miss it.
<h3>3. Keep charcoal on standby</h3>
This is necessary especially if you are using lump charcoal.

It is a practice of emergency to get your food in good heat even if your fire runs out unawares.

You can quickly open the fire box and add some more coals and continue cooking without much damages.
<h3>4. Pre- remove the food before full doneness.</h3>
At least 5 minutes before the food is fully done.

It is scientifically proven that foods still cook for at least 5 minutes after it has being removed from the fire.

Hence, this is an important practice to have the food not to over cook and also allows the sizzling spices in the food to settle well before the food is enjoyed.

Finally, this allows the food to cool to avoid burns in the excitement of eating a good food.
<h3>5. Always be safe when grilling</h3>
This is a super important tip as you will be dealing with a lot of heat.

You want to ensure that you are using heat proof gloves and utensils when grilling so as to not create burns on your body while you cook.

Even on grills, some makes come with cool to touch features on the outside to allow the user handle the grill at ease while cooking.

4418,"5 Of The Best BBQ Rubs For The Tastiest Of Delicacies","You can never go wrong with a bbq rub, and most interestingly, you may rather keep your rub as a secret to get everyone praising you for great dishes. BBQ rubs are that good, but with a bad blend, you will be all the way up for a disaster.

So, to keep you on good grounds, we thought to share 5 of the best bbq rubs that will suit every kind of need. These are the most preferred bbq rubs and sauces which give the best of tastes and leave your foods super crispy on the outside.

Quick tip on using them for excellent results, always ensure to pat dry your meat and generously coat your meat with as much of the rub as you need to ensure that it sticks well on the meat.

However, ensure to gauge your tastes as you drizzle, else you will be up for sharp tastes that are not ideal for a serve.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Choosing your best rubs; what to look out for?</h2>
<h3>What is its purpose?</h3>
Every rub, be it store bought or homemade is put together to spice up different kinds of meats. Many others are all-rounders to spice up all kinds of meat.

The difference here lies in the intensity of the taste to be derived, hence, you will need to consider the deep essence of taste when making a taste choice.

For example; if you are solely up for strong lamb flavoring, we will recommend a specially made lamb rub, but if deep tastes aren’t a key factor, the best option to go for is an all-purpose rub.
<h3>Is it a healthy blend?</h3>
With the outrage of varying sicknesses all around, a major consideration to choosing your rubs will be their contents. This is very important and cannot be considered carelessly.

Avoid strongly chemicalized rubs as these will harm your body in the long run.

Look out for the ingredients list and ensure that 95% of its contents are natural spice blends. These will boost the taste of your foods better and will keep you healthy.

Also, use this list to check for ingredients that you may be allergic to, and avoid the ones that may cause you problems.

It is better to be preventive than sorry. Do not be driven by fancy names, always go for healthy stuff.
<h3>What are your favorite spices?</h3>
Definitely, a must check. We all have our favorite kinds of spices and will definitely love to have one or two in our rubs.

If this is you too, feel free to be selective. Look out for those special ingredients and choose as you desire. However, note that you may be prone to similar aromas always. Hence, if this is not much of an issue for you, happy rubbing!!

Otherwise, mix up your choices for different aromas. The good thing about rubs is the fact that one blend does not necessarily have to serve all, so the mix in taste is flexible. Feel free to alter your them with your special blends until you achieve your desire.
<h3>Are your taste buds that demanding?</h3>
How much of taste levels are you hoping to achieve? Different ingredients offer different things.

Some are great on flavors while others are best on tastes. If you are drawn towards indulging tastes, you may want to choose salt or sugar based rubs to give you these.

Otherwise, if you are for flavors and more blandness, you should look out for rubs that have flavor spices, e.g, paprika, garlic, ginger, celery, and the list is totally up to you.

To be on a safer side as a tip, you can always go for flavor based rubs and create your own tastes with some coarse salt at home.

Like we said earlier, the alteration of your blends is up to you, and the same thing applies here.

This should easily tell you of its goodness making it one that is off the shelves in a split of a moment.

It is the perfect kind to use for absolutely everything that can be grilled or smoked. Great for pork, ribs, steaks, and vegetables, and will have been super perfect if it was that good for chicken, but this is totally a taste bud issue. So, based on your preferences, this is likely to be great on your poultry too.

An all natural spice blend made with chili pepper, bell pepper, mustard flour, celery powder, citric acid, natural flavor, has no MSG and is gluten-free. This a good one when we preach health, and we applaud the makers for this.

It may, however, be a strong blend, so moderation can be considered when using it. Aside from the odds, we advise you purchase more than 1 container, it runs fast in the kitchen and runs fast on shop shelves.

<h2></h2>
<h2>What are the perfect features of good grill grates.</h2>
<h3>Strong and durable</h3>
Grill grates are solely made from metal because of their direct placement over fire or heat, hence for such excruciating pressure on the metal, it has to be made of very good material.

Some tested materials that are proven to be durable are chrome steel, aluminum steel, cast iron steel etc.

Read about the material make of the grill grate before making your purchase to ensure that they are strong and will last you for a very long time.

Cheaply made grates are very likely to go bad shortly and if not careful may melt over the fire while you cook. Make sure to avoid this against pricing.
<h3>Good heat transfer</h3>
Different metals conduct heat higher than others. Some in other cases, like copper, are good for holding high levels of heat which may not be the best if used for your grill grates as this may burn your food fast.

Meanwhile, other metals are good conductors of heat for grill grates which hold in a necessary amount of heat that is transferred to your food while it cooks.

This means, your food doesn't just cook by direct fire only but has some cooking done by the heat contributed from the metal.
<h3>Non-stick surface</h3>
Nobody wants to have to grill and struggle with removing your food from the grates.

Hence, do not compromise on purchasing non- stick grill grates, otherwise, we bet that you will hate your grilling life for a long time.

A non-stick element to consider is porcelain and goodly, most grates come with this feature. Therefore, this should not be hard to find.
<h3>Well designed</h3>
Most standard kinds are lined horizontally, vertically or cross diagonally. These are all fine and should be able to do you a good job.

However, the amount of spacing left between each mark is what you should be considering. The perfect grates should allow you grill small foods like small tomatoes over them without any falling into the fire. This is to ensure that all food kinds can easily be leveled on them.

In the same way, they ought to be straight to allow you balance your food with ease. Crooked grates are a waste of time, so do yourself a favor and ignore them.

Then, if you are up for pretty marks (we think you should) on your foods, they are specially designed grates that can be placed on the standard grates to create those appetizing marks on your food.

Weber 7638 Porcelain-Enameled Cast Iron Cooking Grates"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Cast iron is one of the best-preached metal material and for the grates to be made of them, we couldn’t ask for more.

It has the tendencies of holding good amounts of heat for faster and even cook. It is gladdening that Weber has one of these made with this material. To top it up, it is coated with porcelain which offers a non-stick and durable feature.

If you are on a budget and up to have a grill grate that will last you the longest, this make is the one to go for. Although, it is specifically designed for the Spirit 300 Series. Hence, if your grill is not this make, you may still use cast iron with porcelain coating as a basis for purchasing your kind.

This seems like all you need for a good cook with an amazing grid design to keep your food leveled while you cook.

No need for portions hanging off the grids and no fears of burning your food. You can also be sure to have some really good marks on your food when done because of the rich thickness of metal for the grids.

Quite a pricey kind, but for its make, this is an investment worth the have.

The struggle of having to remove hot grates from the firebox just to add charcoal is solved with this grate. It is hinged to allow you to add charcoal pieces while cooking. Just release the hinge, flip up the opened side and fill up your firebox.

Obviously, with a brand like this, we expected that its material make will not be disappointing and of a truth, these grates are made of stainless steel that will last you for long.

The grids are also well positioned to prevent food from falling into the fire while you cook and firm enough to give you some pretty marks on your food.

Also, handle or adjust the grates with its attached handle, although not cool touch, they still help with easy adjustments. Use a heatproof glove when handling, however.

Finally, remember to clean the grates with a grill brush while still warm to prevent rusts.

It is a stronger make of the above but comes with a standard design.

Like most cooking grates for Weber grills out there, this one allows you to cook your food in all the right senses. It is highly resistant to rust and has grids that keep your food laid evenly while cooking.

Coming in twos per pack, this quality of Weber grates may be expensive but for its durable make, we will say it is a good numbering.

For a good quality stainless steel make, it is advisable to prepare the grates before placing your food on them as these are not non-stick. Make sure to apply some oil for grill grates on them before placing your food on them to prevent the foods from sticking to the metal.

A better option to use will be grill mats to save you the battle of having to remove foods from the grates.

Afterward, clean them while warm to prevent any openings for rust. Although they are specially made to block rusts, it is better to be preventive.

The first thing we love about this one is its design made well to fit into the Q300 or 3000 Weber series.

This again is a shortfall to those who do not have this make of a grill, so, we encourage you to purchase similar qualities of this grate if you are bent on having the same things.

Looking at what it offers, this set of tools are like twins to the other cast iron make in this selection except for the fact this version has proven to rust after a while of use.

It is therefore not as long lasting as the other but will serve you the needs of cooking with perfect doneness, making them pretty and preventing sticking.

It is easy to clean but the same rules apply; clean while warm using a brush for porcelain grates. Afterward, do a water cleaning and dry.

<h2></h2>
<h2>How do you know which injector choose?</h2>
<h3>Check for its capacity</h3>
This is a very preferential feature as you may either prefer to use the injector either domestically or commercially.

It is better to use one with a smaller tank for domestic use which will be fine enough to suit your needs.

On the other hand, do purchase one with a bigger tank for commercial uses as you will not want to have to refill your tank a number of times while prepping your foods up.

The wise choice will obviously save you a lot of time and energy.
<h3>Check the needle type</h3>
Each type may offer different needle size, so as simple as it is, look out for the needle type that you need for what and make your purchase to match it.

You cannot be careless here as the wrong needle type chosen may cost you unnecessarily.

The good thing is that most types come with at least 2 needles for different sizes of meat. So, no need to rush your buy, be sure that it will work for you in numerous meat cases and we believe you will be comfortable.
<h3>How easy is it to clean?</h3>
Remember that the injector will be sitting in liquids that will be injected into meats, so you want to ensure that it is in a clean bacteria free state as much as possible.

Make sure the kind you choose can either be easily separated to be cleaned and sterilized or can be cleaned by a dishwasher.

If it will be tough to do at least any of these two, you know what the answer is. Ignore it!!
<h3>Is the material make good?</h3>
These devices are either made of plastic or stainless steel, which are friendly to interact with the liquids you use.

Whatever your choice is, make sure that the material make is safe, so as to not have your marinade interacting with wrong acids or bacteria.

If you do not want to scan through to hard, then simply go with plastic or stainless steel injectors.

We will call it a power pusher with its 3 needle set that can be used for different textures of meat and other foods. The kit contains a 3-inch, 6-inch, and 12-inch for three different functions.

On design, it says on its packaging to be stainless steel but this only applies to its body but not the handles. So, when cleaning it is best that you do a thorough clean and dry to prevent rusts. Also, wash by hands for a more thorough clean.

It fits perfectly on almost every size of a hand, except for pretty small hands. If this is you, we will advise you get some help from someone with bigger hands so as to not hurt yourself.

We like this brand of a meat flavor injector for its build and good capacity that is perfect for domestic use.

The Grill Beast company goes better to offer a lifetime warranty which allows you return the product with a money back guarantee. With an offer like this, it tells you that its quality is guaranteed.

However, its two 6 inch needles get the job done well which will mean an extra twist of work when you have to work on smaller pieces of meat.

It has a sturdy build and with normal operation should work perfectly fine. Made of stainless steel, this product has proven to be a long lasting make and again, will be best to clean by hand wash to make it last even longer.

It fills in 2 ounces of marinade which is decent for home use. Meanwhile, the best way to fill up the tank will be to do this from the top as the big holes on the needle may not allow for a good suck in.

Gift this injector to a friend and they will be super grateful for the good tool.

It comes with a 12-month warranty but has extra O-rings for replacement. This means if the rings on the original one damages, you will be in a better place if you purchase a new one.

The stainless steel build is awesome even though we will have preferred the handles to be stainless steel too.

All the same, this is a good buy for the money and we trust that you will have a great time using it.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Choosing the most appropriate grill pan</h2>
Grill pans are simply designed inventions but need a few checks here and there to be sure that they are the best kind for an amazing job.
<h3>What's is the material build.</h3>
The best material choice for them is often cast iron for the kind of heavy duty cooking that the pan will be involved.

To prevent your pan from melting over the fire, ensure to get a make that is strong and durable to stand the pressure of direct for heating it.

The good make will also ensure that it holds a good amount of heat to cook the food well
<h3>They should have a non- stick coating.</h3>
Yes and yes!! They ought to.

Grilling is often done with little oil leaving the pan with very little grease to get the work done.

The non-stick element then comes in to ensure that the food does not stick to the bottom of the pan while it cooks. This prevents hardships when cooking.

The non-stick element also comes in handy for ease when cooking, however, ensure that this coating is not a hindrance to the good amount of heat that will be needed to cook the food well.
<h3>They should be properly lined within</h3>
Most grill pans are often lined 1 to 2 centimeters apart with 0.5 centimeters of depth to allow the juices of the food drop

A good set up like this will allow your food to cook out nicely giving you a good press in marks for the appetizing look that you will love to see.

Make sure the lines within are not jam-packed as this will defeat the purpose of having a beautiful grill.
<h3>They should have cool to touch handles</h3>
This is very important as the heated metal will give you a bad burn if the heat reaches its handles.

It is better to choose ones that have cool to touch handles to aid you with comfortable handling.

Using napkins or cooking gloves are ok, but if there is the option to avoid the extra task, you might as well go for it even if it costs you a little more dollars

Le Creuset Square Skillet Grill"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>The cutest grill pan ever!!

Cute but powerful and functional is what this one is. Like the Staub kind, it has deep ridges to cook food at a decent level and leaves pretty grill marks afterward.

It is an ideal one to have as a young couple so you do not need to stress about buying a grill already.

It is affordable and offers a good cooking space to make food for at least 3 people. The pour spouts built in it makes it easy to pour out grease while cooking and this is a rare add up to have for a utensil.

It is a good grill pan for electric stove because of its weight but you can actually use it on all stovetops.

The handle may get too hot while cooking so you will need to be careful when handling. Simply work with gloves and you should be fine.

Finally, cleaning is easy because of its non-stick feature which can be done in the dishwasher.

<h2>Which is the best grill pan?</h2>
A hard choice to make but we go for the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018AGJQA?tag=brobbq-accessories-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>Cuisinart C130-23CR Grill Pan.</strong></a>

It is a good balance between ceramic and cast iron pans meaning it is decently heavy but offers great durability.

Well sized to cook different foods and quantities while yielding good results. It is not uncontrollably heated giving you a decent design on your food but with good doneness.

Note that overly heated pots have the tendencies of destroying the nutrients contained in foods, so a kind that adsorbs just enough heat for a good cook is to be taken. This utensil offers this and we like it for it.

It comes in a range of beautiful colors to keep your kitchen looking pretty. Do not hesitate to get one if you like it too.",

<h2></h2>
<h2>Choosing your most effective kind</h2>
Barbecues without a good bottle of bbq dressing to back your foods up could render your food as bland as can be. It is essential, therefore to not just use any type of relish for the sake of it, but to be specific about the kinds of benefits that you are hoping to achieve.
<h3>What are your taste preferences?</h3>
This is the first thing to consider when making a choice as they come in various tastes.

As the saying goes that one man's meat is another man's poison, the same principle applies to bbq sauces. One kind does not fit all recipes so be specific about your choice of taste.

Some taste options to look out to aid with your pick are:
<h4>Sweet</h4>
These are usually heavily sugar or molasses based and often made with sweet tomatoes. For sweet tooths and for kids, this may be the kind to consider to satisfy the taste buds. It is often recommended to be the most basic kind of bbq dressing to have in the kitchen.
<h4>Spicy</h4>
If you are crazy about heat in your foods, you might want to consider this option to give you that heat in your bbq as well. They are often made with other components but the spicy component found in it is often on the high side to give the obvious taste of heat.
<h4>Tanginess</h4>
This is often a vinegar based causing a strong tangy taste. It may not be the most preferred for a lot of coating as it may leave the food too sour in taste to eat. You can use it with a mix of other kinds of bbq relishes to have a decent balance of tanginess in your food.
<h4>Combos</h4>
These are blends of 2 or more of the above types and often the most common kinds on the market. However, each single supermarket bbq sauce always has one particular feature outshining the others to aid the user to determine tastes better.
<h3>What is your choice of flavors?</h3>
Flavors are also very key aspects to consider when choosing as they have the potential of altering the original taste of the food.

Look out for your preferences whether subtle, strong or none and make a that will fit that need.

It is also important to note that most bbq sauces come with smoky flavors for the fact that barbecues and smoky flavors are very much correlative. So this may be a constant component with varying wood flavor kinds, hence, if this is something that you will not like, you should look out for options without smoky flavors.
<h3>How will it affect your health?</h3>
Some grocery store bbq sauces could be unhealthy to use due to the kind of components used in making them.

Look out for all natural ingredient kinds rather than ones that are chemical based. For this reason, we particularly chose dressings with ingredients that are healthy to use and we believe that some other choices will offer this good aspect.

Also, do an allergy check of yourself if you haven’t yet and go for types that will serve you well. It is important to not do broad assumptions about what you might desire just so you can get the best out of your buy.
<h3>What is the shelf life of the bottled sauce?</h3>
You want to ensure that your potential buy is long lasting and in good state before your purchase.

Always aim for the kinds that have at least 18 months of goodness to their expiry date to ensure that its ingredients are in a good state and will not grow fungus in a long time.

On health, fresh relishes are also usually better for boosting your health needs as they will be made with fresh ingredients which offer great benefits to the body.

On taste, due to their freshness, you can expect to have good tastes as well.
<h3>Do brands really matter?</h3>
No, they do not! However, some brands are known to have produced the best quality of bbq sauces over the years making them easy to rely on.

On the other hand, there are also pretty new brands that offer amazing products that could beat the quality of other older brands by their goodness.

Hence, if you have interests in particular brands, it is wise to do a wide read on them and be sure that they have great reviews before using them. You do not want to poison yourself!

Jack Daniels Original No. 7"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Up for a bourbon bbq sauce? This one has got you in all the right places. Use this on your burgers anytime, all the time; and if you are looking for that American spark in on your shredded barbecue for a burger, this is the best American bbq sauce on the market to get.

It is pretty interesting that Jack Daniels has a barbecue relish line which should get you thinking if it is whiskey based. Well, it is bourbon inspired! A bit of whiskey to set in some flavor which is not overpowering. It is more of a subtle sweet and spicy kind that works well for everyone and any dish.

It is a classic one and with its Hickory flavor in there, you get to have an extra taste of smoky flavors locked into every bite you take.

This product will turn every badly overcooked, bad tasting meat into the most favorite on the table, so if you are considering using it has a marinade, we give you a full go ahead. The whiskey content in it has great tendencies of locking in flavors into meats (all kinds) and even the bones, giving you a total round of flavors in your food.

In a roundup, this goodness gives you a good dash of whiskey that comes after your swallow, sweetness, spiciness, and smokiness.

With a beautiful history to it, it has made its way into the hearts of many, homes and commercial places.

Dating back from 1968, this is just the one that you need on your shelves for just anything you choose to make. With a deep tomato base, molasses, vinegar and chipotle, this is one of the best bbq flavourings you’ll ever taste.

We love it for its sweet, tangy, and spicy taste, making it the perfect all-rounder kind to have.

It is a very natural blend, that almost makes you see a blend of onion and garlic through its opaque texture; and also fairly thick nor thin, giving you globs of the spoon from every scoop.

It may be slightly rough for a bbq topping but this could be passed for the content of its goodness.

This is not overly sweet as may seem from its appearance but sits in all the goodness that you will desire from a bbq sauce the Texas way.

It is packed with bold unique flavors that immediately tweak up the taste of meats of whichever kind you are making.

It is a brand that has stood the test of time on its quality with 25 years of barbecue experience for the perfect flavors.

It is a heavily based on molasses with a blend of vinegar, done so well to not leave an overpowering taste nor dominating sweetness on your foods. It is the best Kansas City bbq sauce out there - giving you a good balance of sweet, thickness, tomatoes and tanginess to it.

Use it on your pork ribs, steak etc and you are sure to have a good bursting aroma of smokiness in every bite. However, tastes may not live up to looks especially on chicken but still leaves a mellowed flavor in there. It is one of the best bbq sauce brands for baby back ribs as a special recommendation from us.

This Bull Eye product may be costive but for its good flavoring, you bet that it is a good cost for such goodness. Its thickness also lets your food sit well in a good coat of topping, and all the better marinates to the core if you decide to use it for marination.

Sweet Baby Ray Original Barbecue Sauce"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Like the name goes, this is a sweet bbq sauce with an amazing smell. This is the type that you want to have as an option for picky eaters, because tell you what, it will get everyone to love it.

If you are looking for a kind of honey bbq sauce, we highly recommend this. It is sugar based with a cut of vinegar and liquid smoke in it to give it a good tasting balance. Spiciness will not be a good attribute for it, making it not very ideal for someone who is high on pepper.

This is the best-recommended sauce for little smokies instead of sweet soda and you will be grateful for its “slightly thicker than ketchup” texture that will leave your sausages coated graciously.

Being a better tasting version of ketchup, you could almost use it on your salads or just anything that you deem fit to have it on. It is great on cost, and often always available on sale to ease the budget.

As a bottled bbq sauce, you are sure to get almost every bit out of its squeezable bottle - this is a great feature by the makers for such a sweet tasting sauce.

Use this for burgers and have a long lasting taste!

Bone Suckin’ Sauce"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>A fierce name for a fierce one! This is the best spicy sauce to have an excellent balance of bbq seasoning.

It is a great sauce for beef ribs sitting a good taste of minor tanginess, very little sweetness, but a good level of spiciness. It has a sweet aroma however which may be disappointing as the actual thing isn't that sweet.

Being very light in texture, you could equally use it as a dip for other delicacies or if you will rather not smear it all over the food for eating preferences. It is also great sauce for pulled pork recipes as the ingredient mix conveniently sits well into the meat as you cook it for a long period.

The jar packaging design is amazing for the many like us who want to have every bit of the sauce out of its container. The wide mouth of the jar allows you to brush out every single bit of it, and there your money is fully retrieved!

Get this relish in its full package; Hot Bone Suckin’ Sauce, Bone Suckin’ Sauce, and Bone Suckin’ Sauce (seasoning and rub) for a very decently discounted amount making it a cheap bbq sauce. We assure you that it will be a great buy for your money.

It is mayo vinegar based with the specialty to enhance the tastes of meats rather than for coating. Hence, on the shortfall side of things, this may not be the type that you will want to coat your meat with.

On tastes, it has a mustardy mayo feel with lingering heat after your swallow from the black pepper add up in it. This makes it very different from mayo although white in color and as creamy as mayo.

Its texture makes it great to use for marination, as it is not too thick or thin, but of average consistency to lock in all other spices that you may use in combination.

Its use is very limited, working best with chicken, but offering an amazing tangy taste to chicken barbecues.

It is a travelogue that leads readers to the best places to find the best barbecues.

Tricky right, but necessary if you are still in for great tastes.

We like the author’s varying approach to doing something out of the ordinary. Leave the cooking, tips, and tricks to the others and get the people to where the food is all ready and in wait for them to devour them.

This way they will be salivating from the word “go” till they find their best places to enjoy great food, and afterward, they will be drooling from thoughts from the previous to make their own always.

This is a smart move and is doing a lot of wonders to this world.

It is a great guide with the perfect detailing of where to find what. Perfect for town visitors who need some traditional taste.

Keep this book close always and you will never go hungry.

4569,"The Best Lump Charcoal Brands For Seamless Cooking","The fuel used when cooking is often tucked at the lowest of things to consider when thinking about how great a food should taste and lump charcoal is of no exception to this practice.

Truth be told, the kind of charcoal used when cooking goes a long way to determine the aromas or flavors to be derived from your cook.

Lump charcoal is the most naturally made kind of charcoal type out there making it the safest and most traditionally flavored kind to use.

They may be more expensive and burn faster, but that is a good expectation for a product that is not altered with chemicals.

In this review, we share 5 of the best lump charcoal brands on the market to aid you with your next purchase.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Some qualities to look out for when purchasing your next bag</h2>
<h3>It should be 100% natural hardwood</h3>
Make sure that the content in your bag is made from purely natural hardwood and has no chemicals, fillers or additives added to it while being made.

These substances can be harmful to the health especially with the many cheap versions of charcoal on the market.

Ensure to do a research on its make and if you are lucky enough to get big bags from the production area that will be a lot more better.

There are still a lot of good makes on the market, take your time to find them.
<h3>Single species wood and flavors are the best</h3>
It may be hard to find a bag of lump charcoal that was made from a single tree as they are often made from a mixture of woods which is alright to use.

However, having a single flavored bag of charcoal will do amazing things to your barbecue and you may want to put in the extra work to find them if you are keen on it.

If you are not able to and can make your own charcoal at home, this isn't hard. All you need is a metal barrel, flavored tree logs, and a lot of time.

Be sure to do a wide read about homemade charcoal before you try it.
<h3>Use larger and bigger pieces</h3>
Purchase a bag with larger sizes of charcoal as they will burn longer and hotter than chips of charcoal.

Effective grilling or smoking is achieved when there is a consistent flow of heat to the food hence sizes like this are more likely to keep you away from adjusting the fire for a while so as to not interrupt the cooking process.

A careful scan will get you one that has a lot more of bigger sizes which will be an easy way to light lump charcoal backed by the chips found in the bag.
<h3>Wood type goes with burning temperature</h3>
Different wood types burn at different temperatures making it a key requirement to look out for when making your choice.

Not to say that slower burning wood types are not good, but the choice has to be based on your needs.

Fast burning charcoal calls for different needs so as slow burning charcoal, hence it is best to pick the kind that works for you per your cook.

A good way to adjusting the temperatures are with the vents on your grill or smoker which will aid you in achieving the level of temperature that you hope to achieve.

Fogo Premium"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>When we talk about having large charcoal pieces to give you a good burn, this brand almost intentionally offers large pieces in its bags. It is the perfect hardwood lump charcoal on this list.

This is a respectable thing to do by a company as it shows a lot of consideration for the customer while producing.

As a result, the pieces burn at a slow pace with just enough heat to cook your food at a stable temperature. Much more, the coal does not spark or pop while burning.

It is the great kind to use when smoking as the pieces will last you a long time before they burn into ashes. Then, talking of ashes, you can expect to not create a mini dumpster of ashes in your firebox because of the quality of wood used to achieve this purpose.

These coals are made from hardwood and not strongly flavored. While the fire burns, the aroma is very subtle giving your food the most natural aromas as possible.

We love this make and we believe you will too.

Royal Oak"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>For the American produced Royal Oak lump charcoal, this bag contains a good amount of large lumps, an even distribution of medium to small pieces, and about 1% of chips and dust.

With this said, we believe the manufacturers also meant well to bag as many large pieces as possible but due to transportation and packing, there was a likelihood that some broke into smaller pieces.

The easy breakage could be as a result of the work of burn given it. It is made from hardwood so this should not cause much of a breakage.

These lumps light up fast and on the other hand, burn at an average pace. It makes it long lasting and offers very minimal ash production during the burn.

Aromas are subtle which is the case of most hardwoods being a blend of oak, maple, hickory and walnut. You are also sure to get a very natural smoke flavor in your foods when you use this.

Finally, it is all natural making very safe to use for food and even for skincare products.

All the better if you make this one time buy that will last for a long time.

What a product that offers you a total quality of charcoal - no scraps, no half-burned wood, just strictly good lumps.

On pieces, this rather has a lot more of medium sized pieces as compared to the larger kinds of the two brands but this means that there will not be a need to crack them up further. They are good to light not as quick as the two brands above also, but great thing is that you may not have any sparks or pops from the time of lighting through the cooking process.

Aromas are stronger on this one due to the blend of hickory and oak, but not overpowering and do not wrongly affect the flavor of foods making it just right to use. After a while, you will get used to it.

Chips and dust in the bag are very little which means ash production during burning is minimal too.

It burns high on temperature, two to three times more than traditional charcoal. So a good spread in the firebox is advisable so as to not burn your foods.

As the name is, it is the recommended lump charcoal for kamado grills.

The bag content combination is majorly large sized with some chips and smaller pieces to aid in lighting the large pieces. It burns in good pace and heats up fairly well for stabilizing temperatures.

These pieces pop when burning but not as bad to drive you away. Being a kamado affair, it passes to be the best lump charcoal for Big Green Egg.

Not to sound off, but the packaging looks good which is an enticer if you are not sure of what charcoal to get and you see it amongst others on the shelves of the shop.

Aromas might not be the most exciting for this as it exudes a strong flavor that may be uncomfortable when using it for the first time. It will not affect the flavors of your food so this is fine to ignore. You will get over it.

Original Natural Charcoal"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>Like the name foretells, this is indeed original. All pieces are done with no additive making our list a complete one of 100% natural lump charcoal.

Most of the content in the bag is a combination of large and medium pieces with a lot more amount of chips unlike the other brands we spoke about; about 9% of the total bag.

Lighting these pieces are the easiest things to do but this means that they burn faster than the rest of the list. They are the best lump charcoal for grilling, hence, do get some extra on hand for refilling.

Aromas are strong with this one and may not be the best for people that are super subtle on this quality. Ash production is low and heat levels are just ok to not cause quick burns.

This is a good make and we will recommend it too like the others.

<h2>What is the best lump charcoal?</h2>
Definitely the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071G84J69?tag=brobbq-accessories-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><strong>Fogo Premium!!</strong></a>

It is the perfect lump charcoal for smoking foods as it does not burn too low nor too high. Due to its strong and large charcoal pieces, temperatures work just well for a long cook.

There are no sparks while it burns to make it also good for barbecuing. You will not be burned except you’re careless.

The wood selection for it is totally made well making it burn without waste, producing almost no ash, and has a very subtle aroma.

We highly recommend this make which is healthy for cooking and passes well for even skin care products.

Enjoy its use and be kind to let us know your thoughts.",

4775,"Grilling Time and Temperature Chart: BBQ to Perfection","After all that’s being said and observed about grilling, there is the obvious fact about temperatures that cannot be ignored in this process.

Paying a good worth of attention to the grill temperature and cooking time during this activity will either turn your food into scrumptious or run it down as unenjoyable.

For this reason, as BBQ enthusiasts, we share this BBQ grill temperature chart to guide you as you cook. Be it beef, fish, seafood, veggies, lamb etc, the guide gives you options to achieve varying levels of doneness.

Meanwhile, it is important to note that this chart is built on approximate estimations to serve as a grilling aid. The technique of grilling comes with experience and skill, so, do not be surprised when you see a Pitmaster alter grilling times and temperatures and still turns out a whopping good dish.

Feel free to do a few adjustments as you desire but ensure that you know what you are about.

As the basics require to put this guide into full effect, equip yourself with a good grill, the choice of fueling that you prefer to use, not forgetting some wood chips (use the perfect type for the perfect cook), your meat of choice, a digital thermometer, and then most importantly, your abling Pitmaster hands.

Now quickly before we delve deeper into some more details about this chart, there’s a valuable trick that differentiates a regular BBQ from that which is done by a pro - “the resting time”.

You will observe in the chart a resting time required to follow before serving your meat and may wonder if this is necessary at all. It is super necessary as there is a thin line between great tasting BBQs and just an okay tasting BBQ. A part of this line lies between cooking and its serving which is its “Resting Time”.

Eating the food right after it has been removed from the fire prevents you from enjoying a balanced and complete taste as compared to it being rested.

The resting time allows the meat to sit in its generated heat from the cook for a few minutes. In the process, the meat finalizes its cook, locks in juices, tastes, flavors, and cools it down slightly making it just very ready to bite in with royalty.

Veggies, however, do not necessarily need this sitting time, simply because you do not want to have them cooking too soft. Therefore, cook your veggies to the level of doneness as you prefer and eat right away!

Now, to the beginning of the infographic and let’s take a majestic walk through the items on the list.
<h2>Types of food to grill</h2>
As clear as the name sounds and as adventurous and creative as you can be, grilling allows you to barbecue just anything (food though!) as you will want.

For the sake of commonality and easy understanding, we use basic food types that can be easily related to. So in here, we talk about beef, lamb, pork, poultry, fish, seafood, and veggies. Choose your lot!
<h2>The thickness of the food</h2>
This relates to the weight of the food rather than its length. Each piece of food weighs differently as a result of the piece of cut that is chosen or offered at the supply store.

For this reason, the heat levels in correlation to time vary when grilling hence the necessity to know what kind of thickness calls for what.

Here, we stick to using an average level of thickness with a serving size of 2 - 4 people to aid you in multiplying your numbers based on your desired serving size.
<h2>The type of heat to use</h2>
What’s the best way to cook your meat to perfection? The answer relies on the recipe being used. Grilling is a faster way of cooking as compared to smoking, however, there is still the option to cook your foods either over direct heat or indirect heat.
<h3>Direct heat</h3>
This positions the food on the grates just exactly above the fire which is an ideal method for cooking fish, veggies, seafood and thinner cuts of meat.
<h3>Indirect heat</h3>
Here, food is cooked by the heat source and not directly over the flames. Often the fire is set on one side of the grate at medium or medium-low and the food is cooked on the other side of the grates.

This style of grilling is best used for thicker cuts of meat that need long slow heat to offer a good cook.
<h2>The surface temperature of the grill</h2>
This is the temperature of the grill/grill grates after preheating which is right for the food to be introduced to.

It is wrong to place foods on the grates immediately the fire is lighted. You stand the chance of sticking your food to the grates which will affect its doneness and beauty, and deteriorate the grill grate faster than its lifespan.

Hence, the necessity to preheat the grill and for the different types of food, there is a call for an ideal temperature to use.
<h2>Grilling Temperature and Time Per Side</h2>
Specifically, you have to cook on both sides and this section talks about the approximate cooking temperature and time to use on each side of the food.

The range reflects the level of doneness to be derived. So, starting from rare to doneness, a higher adjustment from the least to the highest temperature in the range gives you the level of doneness of your food respectively.

Due to the use of heat when cooking, either directly or indirectly, the only appropriate way to detect the doneness of your food is by reading its cooked temperature using a <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-digital-meat-thermometer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>digital meat thermometer</strong></a> with the aid of a temperature guide.
<h2>Ideal grill temperature for different food types</h2>
The temperature control per food type varies mainly by the thickness, cut and recipe of the dish being prepared. In this section, we walk you through the different categories of food to aid you in understanding the chart better as well as many tips to get your A-game on.
<h3>Grilling time and temperature for beef</h3>
[supsystic-tables id=61]

&nbsp;

Beef is one of the commonest go-to choices when the thought of barbecues sets in. Fortunately, the structure of beef in the cow’s body allows for many different cuts, hence, the names like sirloin, tenderloin, rib eye etc as you hear. They are simply derived by the different cuts and we look at the most common and their ideal grilling time.
<h4><strong>Steak</strong></h4>
Steak covers 4 main cuts of beef which are New York Strip, Tenderloin, Rib Eye and T-Bone. These are similar cuts but often bring about the question of what the perfect grill temperature for steak should be.

When grilling steak, a similar range on the grill meat temperature chart follows and in requirement by the USDA the best medium steak internal temperature is 145 °F for nutritional safety. However, for the different doneness desired, a good span of 130 °F to 165 offers you the best.

Steak grilling times are influenced by the level of doneness hoped to be achieved following a similar pattern as temperatures which is totally dependent on the recipe at hand and what beef grilling times are required. Omaha steaks for example work with a 2 to 10 minutes grilling time which is a standard for many others.

If still in a limbo on finding the perfect specifications to grill, it is safe to run on the average as beef tenderloin, rib eye steak, and flank steak grilling times and temperature serve as a basis for achieving equal results on the entire category of steak.

Now, what temperature should the grill be for steak? Simply, work within a range of 360 °F - 400 °F for a good start.
<h4><strong>Filet Mignon</strong></h4>
This is a thicker cut of beef than steak and requires a little extra of time and temperature to get a good barbecue.

So, for an inch thickness, the filet mignon grilling time and temperature spans across the same range for the same levels of doneness for a light thickness of steak.

Interesting fact about the filet mignon, translated to be beef fillet from the French word proves to be the best piece of meat for romantically inspired dishes. It holds up juices and flavors just right.

Fast forward, add this to your surprise romantic recipes and thank us later for the taste.
<h4><strong>Sirloin</strong></h4>
This cut of meat is one of the most loved for busy cooks due to its versatility. It comes between tender and tough cuts, ideal for varying recipes.

The sirloin steak grilling times and temperatures are very flexible spanning across the different ranges for steak because of its versatile texture.

Marinate your sirloin or simply boost it up with a good rub and the results are just incredible. This is why we love the sirloin! Very easy to work with without disappointments.

In a nutshell, the steak grilling times are driven by the thickness of the cut and from the chart, we make it simple for you to multiply numbers averagely for the number of people that you hope to serve.

If unsure about the level of doneness to use, the temperature for medium-rare steak on the grill at 140 °F - 145 °F is a good mark to consider.
<h3>Grilling time and temperature for pork</h3>
[supsystic-tables id=62]

&nbsp;

Just like beef, the pork grill temperature and times follow a similar trend.

The consumption of pork is one of the oldest to hit the earth’s surface and has not disappointed in taste and aroma over the centuries.

When grilling pork, the first key thing to take charge of is marination. Pork has the tendency of exuding a foul odor when not treated well, therefore to avoid this, marinate with stronger spices like garlic, ginger and soy sauce to override the odor.

Now, prep up the surface of the grill to between 300 °F - 400 °F for a great start without the food sticking.
<h4><strong>Pork Chops</strong></h4>
This cut of pork is mostly leaner than most parts of the pig and often includes some rib bones. Hence, the question to ask is what temperature is best to grill pork chops? Straight up on that, we suggest sticking to a medium internal temperature of 145 °F .

It is a faster cooking portion as compared to the other cuts, so to achieve the various levels of doneness, the grill time can be altered between 2 to 7 minutes for such results.
<h4><strong>Pork Tenderloin</strong></h4>
This is a long thin cut of meat best used for bigger serving sizes. It is fast on the cook and requires as much attention as needed for other portions of meat.

The pork tenderloin grill temperature follows the same suit as the pork chops at 145 °F but requires a cooking time of between 10 to 25 minutes per side for the range of doneness.

The meat grill times chart for this goes longer due to the case of length.
<h4><strong>Pork Ribs</strong></h4>
Also known as Spare Ribs, these are a snacky kind of delicacy and can be cooked in almost all forms of cooking that comes to mind.

However, for the love of barbecue, we love the grilled versions best. They are cuts from the lower belly of the pig and are often categorized by beautifully aligned bones.

Due to their snacky nature, spicing ribs usually has no limits. Take a wild recipe from varying cultures and make some scrumptious dish that will leave you sucking on the bones.

The best form to grill ribs is on indirect heat due to its bone structuring. The ideal pork ribs and baby back ribs grill temperature are 145 °F and spans across 30 to 120 minutes of cook.
<h4><strong>Pork Loins</strong></h4>
Pork loins are lengthier and thicker cuts similar to the tenderloin but with a different set up of tissues.

In grilling this cut, aim for a temperature range of 140 °F to 165 °F , and a pork loin grilling time of 4 to 8 minutes.
<h3>Grilling time and temperature for chicken</h3>
[supsystic-tables id=63]

&nbsp;

Chicken is the most commonly consumed piece of meat in the world because it is cheaper to raise and cheaper to purchase. Also, on the grill, it is one of the fastest to cook with mouth-watering results.

What is the perfect grill temperature for chicken? A minimum of 165 °F will keep you safe from any nutritional problems.

Preheat the grill to 350 °F and be ready to cook varying cuts aiming at the same chicken internal temperature of 165 °F on the minimum working across different chicken grilling times.

If you will be working with an oven or a beer can, you should work with a range of 165 °F to 180 °F as the chicken oven grill temperature and 165 °F to 170 °F as the beer can chicken grill temperature.
<h4><strong>Breasts</strong></h4>
These are often the chunkiest of meats and have the tendency of running dry when cooked for long. Chicken breasts serve well with main dishes and are the ideal cuts for chicken kabobs.

In order not to dry out your breasts after a subtle spicing, work with a chicken breast grill temperature of 165 °F - 170 °F for between 6 to 8 minutes per side over direct heat.

Direct heat aids the meat to cook faster attaining this temperature in no time to avoid dryness.

What is the perfect temperature for chicken kabobs then? A 150 °F to 170 °F range working between 2 to 4 minutes per side serves as an average estimation for a good cook.
<h4><strong>Thighs or Legs</strong></h4>
These have larger proportions of meat to bones and are great for main dishes or snacks.

With this, the perfect chicken thigh or leg grilling temperature sits well at 165 °F to 180 °F working at 10 to 15 minutes per side based on the level of doneness you prefer.

This range should often be between medium rare to well done because of the taste and aroma of chicken.

Spice up your thighs with some rubs and a nice coat of finishing sauce after the cook, and be in all awe at the amazing tastes.
<h4><strong>Wings</strong></h4>
No one ever goes wrong with a good spicing of chicken wings. Although with a chemistry still yet to be understood for its heavy bone structure and why it is loved, these have been the best accompaniments for football watching and appetizers.

Now, to get your wings piping hot with flavor and taste, splurge them with a good dose of rub or an overnight marination. Then, barbecue them to a grill temperature for chicken wings at 165 °F - 180 °F over direct heat for 8 to 12 minutes on each side.

They cook very fast so an eye throughout the BBQ will prevent them from burning as they do easily.
<h3>Grilling time and temperature for turkey</h3>
[supsystic-tables id=64]

&nbsp;

A quick run through this thicker portion to chicken just so we have you prepped up for Thanksgiving already. Plan for a longer turkey grilling time than chicken but the same internal grill temperature.

Aim for a range of 165 °F to 175 °F with a time range of 60 - 110 minutes over direct heat.

This approach serves as a basis for other birds like duck, ostrich etc due to their thick-skinned nature.
<h3>Grilling time and temperature for vegetables</h3>
[supsystic-tables id=65]

&nbsp;

Vegetable grilling times take very few minutes to attain a perfect cook at a standard temperature of 350 °F .

Greens, leaves, fruits and stems alike will often work between 3 to 10 minutes on each side because of their lighter, easy heat penetrating textures.

However, tubers like potatoes tend to take a longer time to barbecue due to their tougher textures. Baked potatoes on a gas grill will require a surface temperature of 325 °F to 350 °F but cooked to an internal temperature of 200 °F in the center which is about 90 minutes over indirect heat.
<h3>Average temperatures for other types of food</h3>
<h4><strong>Burgers:</strong></h4>
They are often compacted soft meat and require very less time to cook. The best temperature for grilling hamburgers is 160 °F over direct heat of 400 °F .
<h4><strong>Sausages:</strong></h4>
Sausage and hot dogs should be grilled to an internal temperature of 150 °F to 160 °F over direct heat of 200 °F to 225 °F
<h4><strong>Fish &amp; Seafood:</strong></h4>
These work across very similar times and temperature. For example, the salmon and swordfish grill temperature is 140 °F over direct heat of 400 °F which works the same for many other types of fish.

The temperature to grill shrimp works at 145 °F over direct heat of 450 °F and works alike for other seafood.
<h2>Controlling temperature on different grills</h2>
The level of heat produced by the grill in combination to the management of fire aids with the skill in controlling temperature.
<h3>Charcoal grills</h3>
<a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-charcoal-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>These kinds</strong></a> are usually the hardest to control because of their very natural state. Charcoal burns faster and could create too much heat if you let them loose.

How then do you control temperature on a charcoal grill? The charcoal grill temperature control is simple. Just take note of these three (3): the amount of coals being used per time, the mode of layering the coals and the vents/dampers.

<strong>Amount of coals used:</strong> Although grilling is a faster form of grilling than smoking, this does not mean a dump of plenty of charcoal lumps in the firebox for a good cook.

Work with a minimal amount of lumps based on the quantity of food you are hoping to cook. Larger lumps of charcoal burn slower than chippings so you will want to consider having more of this kind in your selection.

<strong>The mode of layering:</strong> After the charcoal has been placed in the firebox and lighted, spread them out in the fire box for heat distribution as you will prefer. Some options are:

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Even distribution:</span> Here, you want to spread out the pieces across the firebox to allow for an even and direct distribution of heat to the food. This approach will require you to use as little fire as possible so as to not burn the food.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Left and right positioning:</span> Arrange the fiery coals on the left and right side of the firebox leaving the middle blank. This way you can move the food from the left to middle or right to the middle as you cook signifying heating to cooling levels.

It is a good method to give you much control over the amount of heat that gets to the food. A trick to this is to mount one side of the fire box with more charcoal than the other for a higher to lower levels of direct heat. Then, the middle section can serve as an indirect heating zone.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">One-sided positioning:</span> Arrange the fiery coals on just one section of the firebox. Move food from the hot side to the cold side as and when there is a need for it.

<strong>Vents/ Dampers:</strong> These are responsible for the flow of air into the fire hence closing completely, partially closing and completely opening allows for equal quantity of oxygen to get to the fire. Hence, more oxygen leads to more fire and less oxygen leads to less fire.

Working with the above chart which also serves as the charcoal grilling temperature chart, a control of temperature by the above will get you cooking right.
<h3>Gas and Electric Grills:</h3>
These are pretty much easier to control temperature with as they come with burners and knobs to aid control the level of fire being produced. Turn it high or low to give you the amount of fire desired.

Natural gas versus <strong><a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-gas-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">propane gas grill</a></strong> cooking temperatures often give off the same levels of temperature reach as the chart above but are often quickly attained than a charcoal grill. For example, the highest temperature a gas grill gives ranges between 450 °F - 500 °F which implies the fast cook.

In inclusion with <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-outdoor-electric-grill-reviews/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>electric grills</strong></a>, these come with vents also that allow you release heat from the grill as you cook rather than take in air.
<h3>Kamado and Infrared Grills:</h3>
These grills take up a slightly different design and cooking time as compared to the other types of grills.

Kamados are heavily ceramic built meaning they hold up more heat and for longer than many other grills, however using charcoal for fueling mostly.

To control temperature on a kamado grill, simply set up the lumps in the grill, light them up and allow the grill to heat up to the surface temperature required for the food. At that temperature, place your food on the grates, close the lid and keep the vent opened quarterly.

Keep cooking and control temperature using the vents.

On the other hand, infrared grills are one of the fastest cooking grills you can find, cooking food in very few minutes.

Infrared grilling times often last about 5 minutes on the average because of the technology used. Preheat the grill for 1 minute to medium-high heat, then cook your food, about 2 minutes on each side.

Due to the fastness of this grill, it is wise to stick to the grill throughout the cooking process so as to not burn the food.

<h2>A further look at grill temperature controllers</h2>
Basing this section on how some known grills work on temperatures, we do a quick summary on what to expect on some brands and their likes.
<h3>Control temperature on Traegar grill</h3>
This grill works solely by wood pellets and is designed to feed the grilling system with wood pellets as the barbecue is on. The Traeger does not hold accurate temperature often starting at 250 °F , drops to about 215 °F and rises again.

However, a good thing about this make is its grill temperature control that monitors the levels of heat attained by the grill while hot. It has the ability to turn off the feeding system and set off an alarm to notify the user of high levels of heat being attained.
<h3>Control temperature on Weber Grill</h3>
Weber on the hand has varying fueling designed units. For the gas grill, temperature control is simply done using the control knobs while the charcoal grill controls temperatures by two dampers located at the bottom and the top of the grill.

It is good to keep the lower damper opened through the cook while you use the upper damper to control the airflow to the fire.

Weber grill temperatures span from 225 °F  to 500 °F giving you enough room to work at different levels of heat at different grilling times. The Weber grill temperature chart follows the same pattern as ours to keep you on the safe side.
<h3>Control temperature on George Foreman</h3>
George Foreman grills are very unique in design, very portable to fit into any kind of space. It offers a temperature chart or range of 350 °F to 400 °F and shorter grilling times due to its ability to cook food on both sides at a go.

Hence, with our chart, you will only need to stick to the time of cook as given without the need to flip the food.

Preheat the grill for 5 minutes before placing the food in it and then simply use the grill temperature control situated on the lid to increase or decrease the heat levels.
<h3>Control temperature on Green Mountain</h3>
Also a wood pellet grill, the Green Mountain simply works by feeding the firebox with wood pellets by a motor. A grill temperature control is located on the grill or a WIFI enabled feature to control the amount of pellets that are being fed into the fire to increase or decrease heat.

Its grill temperature problems are mainly known to be slower to preheat as compared to other grills which take up to 45 minutes to do so.",%%title%%

<h2>Understanding food and wine pairing.</h2>
We won’t act like we don’t know that understanding the different names of wines can be daunting. Mostly, you just run with either red wine for meats because they are stronger in aroma and taste, and white wine for fish because they are lighter in aroma and taste.

So you ought to be in the know and be conversant with the categories so if anybody puts you on the spot, you have your hat on like a pro.

The infographic below shares five (5) main wines that are the standards for pairing BBQs. Every other type that falls in their category, is a safe pairing element.
<h3>Cabernet Sauvignon</h3>
Being one of the best wines in the red wine category, there have come to be a strong likeness for its breed of grapes for their high level of tannin. This means that the Cabernet Sauvignon has the tendency of staying longer for many years with proven improved taste over the years.

It is a dry wine and not sweet usually leaving an effect of dryness in the mouth after taking. Therefore, the Cabernet Sauvignon should be taken with food for its alcohol content range of 13.5% to 15% per bottle plus its acidity and healthy tannin levels.
<h4>What type of food then fits a Cabernet Sauvignon?</h4>
All red meats are perfect for it. Cabernet is the safest option to have with all grilled steaks because if its rich fruit content and strong flavor. Spicy BBQs may not be the best option for the wines dryness.

Don’t limit yourself, however, it might work for you. Best thing, do a tasting first with the barbecue you’re about to have before serving.
<h2>Malbec</h2>
Trying to cut down some cost of a Cabernet Sauvignon? Go for Malbec. As a selected mix of blackberry, pomegranate, plum, blueberry, raspberry, raisin, and black cherry, it is a highly fruity flavored wine with lesser acidity levels than the Cabernet Sauvignon.

You can find a wide range of flavors for a Malbec giving you the option to explore different recipes with it. They come with a sweet tobacco finish in milk chocolate, violet flower, cocoa powder, and leather.

The tannin level is also lesser than the Cabernet making it an excellent option for leaner meats.
<h4>What should you take with Malbec?</h4>
Leaner red meats, all kinds of poultry, sole, root &amp; green vegetables and a variety of cheese work perfectly. Rather, focus on spices that have a smoky or earthy flavor to create pleasant aromas in your mouth as you eat.

Spices like sumac, parsley, porcini powder, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, smoked paprika, green onion, shallot, juniper berry, cumin, clove, coriander, garlic, barbecue sauce, and garlic are great options.
<h3>Bordeaux</h3>
Bordeaux is simply any kind of wine made in Bordeaux, France but that’s not all there is to it, this range has some pretty good qualities that will turn your bbq into something amazing.

Bordeaux wine is a two range production of wines falling into the Left Bank which is dominated by the Cabernet Sauvignon being red wine and the Right Bank with Merlot taken charge as its white wine range.

The Merlot could be dry or sweet and really depends on what you are making, your wine option can be decided.
<h4>Which should go with Bordeaux?</h4>
Like mentioned earlier, the Cabernet Sauvignon works best with red meats because of its strong flavor and taste. Pretty much, the red wine collection under the Bordeaux works equally in this manner.

On the other hand, the Bordeaux white wine collection like the Merlot works perfectly for light foods; vegetables, fish, leaner meats, poultry, and cheese. Get these worked up on your <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-gas-grill-reviews/"">best gas grill</a> and you will be up for fabulous times.
<h3>Cava</h3>
Cava is a sparkling wine originating from Spain and could be easily be mistaken to be champagne. Although pretty close, the difference simply lies in the types of grapes used which do not make Cava sweet.

These three (3) main grapes are Macabeu (white grape), Xarel-lo (white grape), and Parellada (white grape) which get blended with other types of grapes for the white or rose colors and difference in flavor and taste that you get.

Cava is simply a mid- affordable wine that goes well with every light food.
<h4>Some light foods to use cava for</h4>
Use it for burgers, sausages, all types of poultry, fish, seafood, and root vegetables. Also, work with mild flavoring when barbecuing to give you a subtle blend of flavor.
<h3>Rose</h3>
This pink wine is unique for its production method which is farfetched from the way the red wine or white wine is made. Red or white wine is simply juiced out of the grapes and fermented over a period of time. This means red grapes produce red wine and white grapes produce white wine.

On the other hand, Rose goes through a process called maceration which produces the pretty pink color that is seen. Red wine is juiced out of red grapes and the grapes’ skin is allowed to sit with the juice for two to three day. Just when the juice begins to take on a beautiful pink color as the winemaker desires, then the skin is immediately removed.

The juice is then allowed to ferment and voila, pretty pink Rose for your tall glasses.
On cost, Rose ranges from affordable to expensive due to its wide range of products but truth be told, the best Rose wines are from Provence. If unsure of which kind to buy, just ask for the type from Provence, you’ll be grateful for this advise.
<h4>What should you take with a Rose?</h4>
Everything like the Cava and more. You’re in a good place when you have Rose with burgers, sausages, poultry, fish, seafood and then all types of vegetables and cheeses.
<h2>Which is the best wine for BBQ?</h2>
A pretty hard one but we’ve got the answer. Maybe we will spill it over a table of sumptuous BBQ…..we got you there!

The Malbec is the friend in need when cost is against you or time or indecision. It works well with all types of foods even with stronger flavored meats except you are really particular and will cringe if you can’t find a Cabernet Sauvignon.

The Malbec is affordable, widely available, and always taste great. Use it chilled and enjoy the flavors that it brings. Guess what? You can always save on a Merlot to buy some trendy <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-bbq-grill-accessories/"">best BBQ accessories</a> to boost your barbecue life up.

<h2>A walk through a beer pairing chart</h2>
Beers may taste almost similar but vary in their outcomes especially when paired with different foods. Beer and food pairing is pretty tricky and the great trick for getting it right relies on your spicing.

When thinking of something heavier and carb loaded for a BBQ, beer is the right drink to consider and in this infographic below, we match some kinds with the foods that work best with them.
<h3>Porter</h3>
Porter is such an old beer, even older than Guinness, and yet still in available production till date. For its hearty taste, beef seems to be the best for it. It has an excellent nutty flavor with aromas of toffee making it blend well with the strongest flavor of beef.

Once beef is barbecued, the roasted aroma exuded blends well with the toffee aroma we talk of.
<h3>Brown &amp; Blonde Ales</h3>
Brown ales are year-round beers which work well with beef, pork, and poultry. This pairing lends itself to its nutty and slightly nutty flavor while being slightly bitter. Really based on where brown ale is produced, either in America, England or Belgium, its taste could vary and hint with notes of chocolate and caramel.

The blonde ales, on the other hand, are averagely bitter with a higher use of malt in its production. They go best with some vegetables and stronger spicing of beef, pork, and poultry dishes.
<h3>German Lagers</h3>
German lagers have been a great collection dating back from over a century ago with the likes of the rauchbier, pilsner, and helles in its section which range from a high to low mixture of alcohol and hubs.

Although German Lagers may have had some backlash in recent times to be less of good than the American Lagers, we really still believe that they offer some unique great tastes and of course, we don’t expect all beers to be the same. There ought to be some variety, that’s the beauty of drinks.
<h3>Rauchbier</h3>
These are smoked beers made from a high portion of malt and one of the best kinds of beers to use for food pairing.

Use rauchbier for sausages and poultry for an unexplainable aroma and taste. They have strong meaty aromas hence something with lighter aromas will balance out nicely.
<h3>Pilsner / Helles</h3>
Pilsner beers can be likened to a Cava for its floral and sweet aroma and high carbonation. They are also a mixture of alcohol and hub which makes them work well with beef, poultry, vegetables, pork.

Pilsners made lately are often an expensive option to go for sometimes because of the difficulty to make them less stale than those of the earlier days.

Helles are the total opposites of Pilsners which are maltier and sweeter making them an excellent choice for fish, seafood, cheese, and veggies. They are a lighter colored beer and lighter in texture also.
<h3>IPA</h3>
IPAs are a breed from India with a lighter aroma than the Rauchbier making it a perfect pair for beef, poultry, pork, strong aroma cheeses, and vegetables.

IPAs are widely drunk beers and don’t look like there’s any stopping soon for the rich quality of alcohol and hub mixture that it comes with. They taste sweet, sour, salty, umami, and/ or bitter depending on the brand being used hence the wide range to choose from.

Make sure to enjoy it chilled as always and you won’t regret your choice.
<h2>Which is the best beer for pairing BBQ?</h2>
It’s almost difficult to mention just one beer that fits all needs, this puts us in a dilemma. However, from our review, the most likely beer to suit all needs will be the Ales as both combined fit very well with all food types.

Let’s say you have a full pack of either brown or blonde ales, just work with the flavoring of the food to give you a good balancing of whichever.
<h2>Some tips for pairing drinks with barbecue.</h2>

5113,"[Không post bài này nữa] A Beginner’s Guide To Grilling","One of the best feelings in the world is having your friends over on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, enjoying a beer or a glass of red wine and cooking a barbecue, while sharing some stories. A grill will provide a way for you to enjoy delicious foods out in the yard or inside, in front of the TV.

Back in the days, barbecuing used to be pretty straight forward. However, grilling has turned into a regular form of art, as there are so many ways to prepare good food for everyone to enjoy. In today's article, we are going to go over the basics that you need to know before you start grilling.

&nbsp;
<h2>Firing up the Grill</h2>
It doesn’t really matter if you prefer grilling <a href=""https://www.backyardboss.net/best-charcoal-grill-review-gas-bbq/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>indoors or outdoors</strong></a>. Different types of grills require different methods of putting up a fire.

For charcoal grills, you need to make sure that you have removed the debris that was left from the previous cooking. Not cleaning the grill will cause your current food to grill unevenly or even get burned. To light up a charcoal grill, you will need either briquettes or lump charcoal.

The latter type is nothing more than just burned down pieces of wood, while the former is made charcoal pieces combined with the binders and other products.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5120"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/charcoal.jpg"" alt=""charcoal"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

If you own a gas grill, then you already know that it operates very similar to a stove. Before you start grilling, you need to make sure that you have enough fuel at hand to keep the grill up and running for as long as you need to cook.

If your gas grill has multiple burners, then you will benefit from several cooking zones. This means that you can cook different types of food at different temperatures, all at the same time.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5119"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bbq-grill.jpg"" alt=""bbq-grill"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

<h2>Cleaning Up the Grill</h2>
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5121"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cleaning-Up-the-Grill.jpg"" alt=""charcoal"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />
Trying to cook food on a dirty grill is both unsanitary and distasteful. Even if you are using a brand-new grill, you still need to clean it to make sure that you have removed any shipping or package residue that may have been left behind. The grate of your grill should be cleaned and oiled to make sure that nothing sticks to it.

Cleaning your grill after every use ensures that your food is tasty and that the grill itself will have a longer lifespan. Make sure that you don't start cleaning your grill right after you have finished cooking, as the parts may be too hot, and you will end up getting burned. There are several types of gas grills that have their own cleaning setting. Even so, it will still require some manual washing.

&nbsp;
<h2>Tools</h2>
In order to become the true barbecue master, you need to know the terminology associated with the different tools you need to prepare a successful meal.

In order to clean your grill, you will need a grill brush. You should always keep this at hand as it'll motivate you to clean the grill after each use.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5122"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/barbecue-brush-potatoes-marinade.jpg"" alt=""barbecue-brush-potatoes-marinade"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

For grilling, you will also need a good pair of gloves because heat will cause major discomfort to your hands. There are very specific flame-resistant gloves that will absorb the heat and make it easier for you to use the grill.

Tongs are considered to be one of the most essential drilling accessories. Tongs make it easier for you to move food from one part of the grill to another. It’s great for turning hot dogs, sausage, vegetables and more.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5123"" src=""https://brobbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/barbecue-grill-pliers.jpg"" alt=""barbecue-grill-pliers"" width=""800"" height=""450"" />

Spatulas are also essential when grilling, because they help you flip the food without having to use any additional tools. Spatulas are ideal for cooking burgers or some other form of delicate food.

You should always have what is known as a “squirt bottle” near the grill. Basically, this is just a normal plastic bottle with a couple holes punctured in the cap. The squirt bottle is very useful in case the grill flame rises too high and you need something to keep it under control.

The more foods you cook inside your grill, the more essential a <a href=""https://brobbq.com/best-digital-meat-thermometer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><strong>thermometer</strong></a> becomes. There are special thermometers that you stick inside your meat, to make sure you've properly cooked it.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Even if we've gone through the essentials of grilling, there are a lot more things that you should know in order to be fully prepared before firing up the grill. The first thing you need to master is patience. You won't be able to make a good steak if the grill isn't ready. A good chef always organizes his or her grill space in order to have all the ingredients needed at hand.

Another very important tip is to never leave the grill unsupervised, no matter how tempted you are to believe that you have things under control. Fire changes constantly and you should always keep an eye on it. If you need to take a bathroom break while the grill is running, ask someone else to keep their eyes on it while you are away.",
